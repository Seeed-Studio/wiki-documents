The eMMC versions of ODYSSEY-X86 will have Windows 10 pre-installed into the device. If you install another OS and wanting to go back to the original Windows 10 please check here:

- [**Original Windows 10 Image**](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ODYSSEY-X86J4105-Ant-image/SD-JX-CJ41G-M-101-H.zip)

  - This image supports **Auto Flash**. Simply download the above image and unzip the files and place in the **root location of a USB drive**.

  - Plug in the USB drive to ODYSSEY-X86 and boot up from the USB Drive. This will auto flash the Original Windows 10 Image back in the eMMC.
