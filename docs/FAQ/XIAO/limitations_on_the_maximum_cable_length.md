The maximum cable length for the CAN bus connection depends on factors such as the baud rate, cable quality, and electromagnetic interference. In general, for lower baud rates, longer cable lengths (up to several hundred meters) can be supported. However, for higher baud rates, it is recommended to keep the cable length shorter (within a few meters) to maintain reliable communication.
