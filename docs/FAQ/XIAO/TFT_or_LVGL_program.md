Updates to the TFT library and the LVGL library may cause the procedures in the tutorial to fail. We recommend that you use our [tested and stable versions of the libraries](https://github.com/limengdu/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-Round-Display-lvgl8.3.5/tree/main/libraries), which you can use without even having to change the configuration in them yourself.
