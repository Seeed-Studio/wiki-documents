## New Wiki Added

### 1. Grove Shield for Arduino Nano

[Grove Shield for Arduino Nano](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Shield-for-Arduino-Nano-p-4112.html) provides you a simple way to connect with [Arduino Nano](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Arduino-Nano-v3-p-1928.html) and also [Seeeduino Nano](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-Nano-p-4111.html). This shield helps you get rid of breadboard and jumper wires by pulling out the pins of the motherboard and expanding to 8 Grove connectors, including 3 Grove digital connectors, 3 Grove analog connectors, 1 Grove I2C connector, and 1 Grove UART connector. We have prepared a [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_Shield_for_Arduino_Nano/) to help you get started with Grove Shield for Arduino Nano quickly and easily!

### 1. Build Ardupy firmware from source code

Ardupy is our latest introduction and provides a brand-new way of communicating with your Arduino boards. Through ArduPy, you can use Python to verify your ideas, learn python programming as well as micro-controller programming in a more efficient way. 
We are working hard to constantly develop Ardupy and bring you many new feature. This week we have have prepared a [step-by-step guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Building-Ardupy/) to help you explain how to build Ardupy firmware by youself! This means you can now add your own hardware to support Ardupy by building your own version of Ardupy.

### 2. Grove - Thermal Imaging Camera IR Array visualization via serial monitor

We have recently released the [Grove - Thermal Imaging Camera IR Array](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Thermal-Imaging-Camera-IR-Array-MLX90641-110-degree-p-4612.html). This is an IR thermal camera carrying a 16x12 array of thermal sensors (MLX90641) and it can detect the temperature of objects from far away with a center area accuracy of ±1℃ and average accuracy of ±1.5℃. We have added the necessary software codes to it's [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Thermal-Imaging-Camera-IR-Array/#outcome-of-visualization-format) in order to visualize the temperature data on the serial monitor while it's connected to the [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html).
