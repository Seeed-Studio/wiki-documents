### 2. Grove - Speaker Plus

We released the latest version of the currently exciting Grove - Speaker and named it Grove - Speaker Plus. Compared to the last version of Grove Speaker, Grove Speaker Plus has a better quality speaker with replaceable speaker design. We have prepared a [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Speaker-Plus/) for this module to help you get started quickly.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Speaker-Plus/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/May%20Week%204/speaker%20plus.png" alt="pir"  width="500" height="auto"></a></p>





Grove Speaker Plus consists of a powerful amplifier driver board and a high-quality speaker. The speaker generates different tones with different input frequencies and it is easy to control with PWM signals. You could create distinctive sound effects, play your favourite songs, or build your own music box with easy coding and explore a large number of existing music codes.

### 3. Grove - I2C Hub (6 Port)

We have also prepared a [wiki page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C-Hub-6Port/) for the Grove - I2C Hub (6 Port). 
Grove - I2C Hub (6 Port) is an I2C expansion interface board. Compared with the previous Grove - I2C Hub, it has the same size with two more connectors at almost half the price!

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C-Hub-6Port/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/IMAGE/May%20Week%204/I2C%206%20port.jpg" alt="pir"  width="270" height="auto"></a></p>




### 4. Water Flow Sensor

We have had the Water Flow Sensor and now we have prepared a [wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Water-Flow-Sensor/) page for you to easily get started with this sensor.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Water-Flow-Sensor/"><img src="https://blog.seeedstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Water-flow-sensor-principle-1.gif" alt="pir"  width="750" height="auto"></a></p>

This Water flow sensor consists of a copper body, a water rotor, and a hall-effect sensor. When water flows through the rotor, rotor rolls and its speed changes with different rates of flow. And the hall-effect sensor outputs the corresponding pulse signal. This is suitable to detect flow in water dispensers or coffee machines. 





### 5. Lipo Rider Plus

We have had the Lipo Rider Plus and now we have prepared a [wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Lipo-Rider-Plus/) page for you to easily get started with this sensor.

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Lipo-Rider-Plus/"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Lipo-Rider-Plus/img/GIF2.gif" alt="pir"  width="700" height="auto"></a></p>


This is not only a charger but also a power supply and a booster. With the help of Lipo Rider Plus, you can input a 3.7V lipo battery, and output up to 5V/2.4A via the USB Type-A port. With the on-board switch, you can control the ON/OFF of USB port easily. Meanwhile, we provide a fully functional pin header, which can output 3.3V/250mA as well.
