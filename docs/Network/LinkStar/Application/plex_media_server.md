## What is Docker ?

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/docker.png" alt="pir" width="200" height="auto"/></p>

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications within lightweight, isolated containers. Containers are self-contained units that package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files, allowing it to run consistently across different environments. Docker simplifies the process of creating, distributing, and running applications, making it easier to develop and deploy software in a consistent and reproducible manner. With Docker, developers can encapsulate their applications and ensure that they run smoothly across different operating systems and infrastructure setups, making it an invaluable tool for building portable and scalable applications, streamlining development workflows, and enabling efficient collaboration among team members.

## What is Plex?

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/Plex_logo.png" alt="pir" width="200" height="auto"/></p>

[Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv) is a powerful media management and streaming platform that allows users to organize, access, and stream their personal media library across various devices. With Plex Media Server, users can effortlessly centralize their collection of movies, TV shows, music, photos, and more, creating a unified media hub within their home network. Plex automatically organizes and indexes media files, fetching metadata like descriptions, artwork, and subtitles, to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The server can be accessed through dedicated Plex apps on smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and streaming devices, enabling seamless streaming of media content both at home and remotely. Plex Media Server also offers robust features such as parental controls, multi-user support, and transcoding capabilities, ensuring compatibility and optimal streaming quality on different devices and network conditions. Overall, Plex Media Server empowers users to enjoy their personal media collection anytime, anywhere, providing a comprehensive and immersive entertainment experience.

## Set up the Docker environment on the LinkStar OpenWRT router.

- **Step 01**  Installing OpenWRT on LinkStar

To begin the process of installing OpenWRT on your LinkStar device, refer to the comprehensive installation guide provided in the LinkStar Wiki. This tutorial focuses on utilizing the OpenWRT system and demonstrates how to install the Plex Container while ensuring that LinkStar functions as a soft router.
Choose one of the following options based on your preference for installing OpenWRT on LinkStar:
1. Flashing OpenWRT onto the TF card. [Here is the tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/linkstar-install-system/#flash-openwrt-to-the-tf-card)
2. Flashing OpenWRT onto the eMMC. [Here is the tutorial](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/linkstar-install-system/#flash-openwrt-to-emmc)

- **Step 2**: Configuring the LinkStar Network

To begin configuring the network settings on your LinkStar device, establish a connection by connecting it to your computer via a network cable. Access the OpenWRT operating backend by entering the IP address 192.168.100.1 into your web browser.The initial account password is:

```
Account: root
Password: password
```
Once logged in, the next step is to establish an internet connection for your LinkStar device.
You have the option to connect either via a network cable or through WiFi. Choose the connection method that suits your setup and preferences. Here I used wireless method. After selecting the wireless network you can simply enter the passphrase and save and apply it.

- **Step 3** : Increasing Docker Storage Capacity

By default, the Docker installation on LinkStar has a storage capacity of around 250MB, which may not be sufficient for installing images. Therefore, we need to allocate more space to Docker to accommodate our requirements.
To begin, navigate to the System section in the OpenWRT operating backend. Then, click on Disk Man and locate the **EDIT** option.


<div align="center"><img width ={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/img2.png"/></div>


In the **"END SECTOR"** column, specify the desired size of the additional storage space to be allocated for Docker. In this example, we will add 20GB of storage. After entering the value, click on the **"NEW"** button to create the new storage allocation.

<div align="center"><img width ={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/img3.png"/></div>

Choose the ext4 format, then click FORMAT button.

<div align="center"><img width ={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/img4.png"/></div>

<div align="center"><img width ={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/img5.png"/></div>

Once the allocation is complete, you will notice the addition of a new 20GB space. However, this space is currently unmounted and needs to be associated with Docker.
To proceed, navigate to the System section in the OpenWRT operating backend and select Mount Points. Look for the Mount Point section and click on the **"ADD"** button.

<div align="center"><img width ={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/img6.png"/></div>

Choose the new space you've just created.

<div align="center"><img width ={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/img7.png"/></div>

Choose the Mount Point Use as **Docker data (/opt)**. Don't forget to check the checkbox Enable this mount, then click **SAVE & APPLY** button.

<div align="center"><img width ={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkStar/plex/img8.png"/></div>


After completing the necessary settings for the storage expansion, the final step is to reboot the LinkStar device to apply the changes.

To initiate the reboot process, go to the System section in the OpenWRT operating backend and select Reboot. Click on the **"PERFORM REBOOT"** button to begin the reboot process. Wait for OpenWRT to restart, and then proceed to log in again once the system is ready.

- **Step 3** : Configure Bind Mounts

 Under the bind mounts section, add the following lines one by one:

        /plex/database:/config
        /plex/temp:/transcode
        /plex/media:/data

- **Step 4**: Submit Configuration

    After configuring the container name, network, environments, and bind mounts, click on the "Submit" button to save the changes.
    
    
    By following these steps, you will successfully configure the Plex container with the specified settings.
