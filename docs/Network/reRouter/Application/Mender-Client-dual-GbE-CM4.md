We can setup Mender Client on a Dual Gigabit Ethernet Carrier Board for Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 and then receive OTA updates from a Hosted or Self-Hosted Mender Server.

This guide focuses on using a Dual Gigabit Ethernet Carrier Board for RPi CM4 running a custom Linux System compiled using the Yocto Project.

## Test results

The Yocto Project releases in the table below have been tested by the Mender community. Please update it if you have tested this integration on other [Yocto Project releases](https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases?target=_blank):

| Yocto Project | Build | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| dunfell (3.1 / 5.3.0) | test works | test works |

**Build** Means that the Yocto Project build using this Mender integration completes without errors and outputs images.
**Runtime** Means that Mender has been verified to work on the board. For U-Boot-based boards, the [integration checklist](https://docs.mender.io/devices/integrating-with-u-boot/integration-checklist?target=_blank) has been verified.

## Prerequisites

- A supported Linux distribution and dependencies installed on your workstation/laptop as described in the [Yocto Mega Manual](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#detailed-supported-distros)
  - NOTE. Instructions depend on which Yocto version you intend to use.

## Configuring the build

### Setup Yocto environment

Create a directory for your  `mender-dual-gbe-cm4`  setup to live in and clone the meta information.

```
mkdir mender-dual-gbe-cm4 && cd mender-dual-gbe-cm4
```

Get all of necessary layers:

```
git clone -b master git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky layers/poky
git clone -b dunfell https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/meta-seeed-cm4.git layers/meta-seeed-cm4
git clone -b master git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi layers/meta-raspberrypi
git clone -b dunfell https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git layers/meta-openembedded
git clone -b dunfell git://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender layers/meta-mender
```

In order to be compatible with meta-raspberrypi, change the gstreamer version of poky to the latest

```
cd layers/poky
cp -r meta/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer/ ../
git checkout dunfell
rm -r meta/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer/
cp -r ../gstreamer/ meta/recipes-multimedia/
rm -r ../gstreamer/
```

Modify the meta-raspberrypi to avoid compile error

```
cd layers/meta-raspberrypi
rm dynamic-layers/meta-python/recipes-connectivity/lirc/*.bbappend
sed -i '/^LAYERSERIES_COMPAT_raspberrypi/s/= .*$/= "honister dunfell"/g' conf/layer.conf
sed -i 's/arm\/armv8a\///g' conf/machine/raspberrypi4-64.conf
```

Modify the meta-mender to avoid compile error

```
cd layers/meta-mender
rm meta-mender-raspberrypi/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-raspberrypi-rt_%.bbappend
sed -i 's/"0x4000"/"0x1f000"/g' meta-mender-raspberrypi/recipes-bsp/u-boot/u-boot-raspberrypi.inc
sed -i 's/bootfiles/rpi-bootfiles/g' meta-mender-core/classes/mender-part-images.bbclass
```

### Setup build environment

Initialize the build environment:

```
source layers/poky/oe-init-build-env 
```

Add yocto project layers:

```
bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-raspberrypi
bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-seeed-cm4
bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-openembedded/meta-oe
bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-openembedded/meta-python
bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-mender/meta-mender-core
bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-mender/meta-mender-raspberrypi
bitbake-layers add-layer ../layers/meta-mender/meta-mender-demo
```

### Configure Mender server URL (optional)

This section is not required for a successful build but images that are generated by default are only suitable for usage with the Mender client in [Standalone deployments](https://docs.mender.io/architecture/standalone-deployments?target=_blank), due to lack of server configuration.

You can edit the `conf/local.conf` file to provide your Mender server configuration, ensuring the generated images and Mender Artifacts are connecting to the Mender server that you are using. There should already be a commented section in the generated `conf/local.conf` file and you can simply uncomment the relevant configuration options and assign appropriate values to them.

Build for Hosted Mender:

```
# To get your tenant token:
#    - log in to https://hosted.mender.io
#    - click your email at the top right and then "My organization"
#    - press the "COPY TO CLIPBOARD"
#    - assign content of clipboard to MENDER_TENANT_TOKEN
#
MENDER_SERVER_URL = "https://hosted.mender.io"
MENDER_TENANT_TOKEN = "<copy token here>"
```

Build for Mender Demo Server:

```
# https://docs.mender.io/administration/demo-installation
#
MENDER_DEMO_HOST_IP_ADDRESS = "<IP address of Mender demo server>"
```

Build for Mender Production/ Self-Hosted (on-prem):

```
# https://docs.mender.io/3.1/system-updates-yocto-project/build-for-production
#
# Uncomment below and update the URL to match your configured domain
# name and provide the path to the generated server.crt file.
#
# Note that a custom server.crt file is only necessary if you are using
# self-signed certificates.
#
# NOTE! It is recommend that you provide below information in your custom
# Yocto layer and this is only for demo purposes. See linked documentation
# for additional information.
MENDER_SERVER_URL = "<URL of Self-Hosted Mender Server>"
FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend_pn-mender-client := "<DIRECTORY-CONTAINING-server.crt>:"
SRC_URI_append_pn-mender-client = " file://server.crt"
```

## Building the image

You can now proceed with building an image:

```
MACHINE="dual-gbe-cm4-mender" bitbake core-image-base
```

Replace `core-image-base` with your desired image target.

## Using the build output

After a successful build, the images and build artifacts are:

- `build/tmp/deploy/images/dual-gbe-cm4-mender/core-image-base-dual-gbe-cm4-mender.sdimg.bz2`

if you already have Mender running on your device and want to deploy a rootfs update using this build, you should use the [Mender Artifact](https://docs.mender.io/architecture/mender-artifacts?target=_blank) files, which have  `.mender`  suffix. You can either deploy this Artifact in managed mode with the Mender server (upload it under Releases in the server UI) or by using the Mender client only in [Standalone deployments](https://docs.mender.io/architecture/standalone-deployments?target=_blank).

## Flash instructions

Please follow [this wiki guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Dual-Gigabit-Ethernet-Carrier-Board-for-Raspberry-Pi-CM4/#flash-to-emmc-cm4-emmc-version) to learn about flashing the above image to the eMMC on the board.

Once flashed, when you turn on the reTerminal, it will boot from the compiled image.

## Boot Success

If you see the following log from UART, that means the system has successfully booted
