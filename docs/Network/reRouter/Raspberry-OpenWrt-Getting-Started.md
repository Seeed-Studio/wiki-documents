## Quick Start with Mini Router

### OpenWrt Pre-Installed

The Compute Module 4 comes with¬†<a href="https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/OpenWrt-Getting-Started/" target="_blank"><span>OpenWrt Firmware</span></a> out-of-the-box. This means you just need to unbox the package, take out the board, connect to your existing home network and have your own mini router!

OpenWrt is an open-source Linux operating system which runs on embedded devices/ routers. It offers more features, performance, and security than a traditional router. It has a filesystem that‚Äôs fully writable and includes a package management system. You can make use of these packages to suit your applications in various ways. Once you connect this board to your home network and access the router from a web browser, you will be presented with a beautiful and interactive dashboard as follows.

## 2 Step to run Mini Router with OpenWrt

## FAQ

### Q1 I can‚Äôt change root password on OpenWrt because of the read-only file system. How should I deal with it?

It can be solved by reflashing the image on to the eMMC.

### Q2: What if I connect the OpenWrt router to my existing router which has a default gateway IP of 192.168.2.1?

Seeed OpenWrt image comes preconfigured with the necessary network settings. You might only need to change one network setting for the scenario which involves the Dual Gigabit Ethernet Carrier Board for Raspberry Pi CM4 connecting to your existing router, and the router has the default gateway IP set to 192.168.2.1 which is the same as the default gateway IP for OpenWrt. In this scenario, you need to change the default IP of LAN interface on OpenWrt as follows:

- **Step 1.** Open a web browser and log in to the OpenWrt portal by typing **192.168.2.1**

- **Step 2.** Navigate to **System > TTYD Terminal** and login with **root** as the username

- **Step 3.** Open the following file

```sh
vi /etc/config/network
```

- **Step 4.** Change the static IP address on the LAN interface as follows

```sh
config interface 'lan'
        option type 'bridge'
        option ifname 'eth0'
        option proto 'static'
        option ipaddr '192.168.3.1'
        option netmask '255.255.255.0'
        option ip6assign '60'
```

**Note:** Here the static IP is changhed to **192.168.3.1**. However, you can type any IP address of your choice

- **Step 4.** Reboot the router

```sh
reboot
```

### Q3: What if I have the Dual Gigabit Ethernet Carrier Board non-CM4 version and attach a CM4 without emmC?

If you want to use a Compute Module 4 without eMMC on the Dual Gigabit Ethernet Carrier Board, then you need to flash OpenWrt on to a micro-SD card and insert it into the board. Follow the steps below according to your operating system.

- **Step 1.** Insert a micro-SD card to the computer using a **micro-SD card reader** connected to the computer, or by using a **built-in card reader** on a laptop

- **Step 2.** Download **balenaEtcher** software by visiting [this link](https://www.balena.io/etcher) according to your operating system

- **Step 3.** Run **balenaEtcher** as **administrator**

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/OpenWrt/balena-home.jpg" alt="pir" width="650" height="auto"/></p>

- **Step 4.** Click **Flash from file** and point to the OpenWrt image file that you downloaded before

- **Step 5.** Click **Select target** and select the connected micro-SD card

- **Step 6.** Finally, click **Flash!**

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="http://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/OpenWrt/balena-finish.jpg" alt="pir" width="650" height="auto"/></p>
