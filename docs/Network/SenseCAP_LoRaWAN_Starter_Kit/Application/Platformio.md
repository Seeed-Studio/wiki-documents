#### LoRaWAN Network Server (ChirpStack)

This section provides guidance on connecting to a local LoRaWAN network server, using the [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/) platform as our primary example. We'll specifically focus on using the [SenseCAP M2 Multi-Platform LoRaWAN Indoor Gateway (EU868)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Multi-Platform-LoRaWAN-Indoor-Gateway-SX1302-EU868-p-5471.html) for this purpose.

- [Connecting to TTN](/Network/SenseCAP_Network/SenseCAP_M2_Multi_Platform/Tutorial/Connect-M2-Multi-Platform-Gateway-to-The-Things-Network/)
:::

## Preparatory work

Now, let's get started. We'll do following things.

### LoRaWAN Network

To ensure successful communication with the LoRaWAN network via your Wio-E5 module, there are a couple of key aspects you need to verify:

1. **LoRaWAN Coverage:** 
   - Make sure that your device is within the coverage area of a LoRaWAN network. For instance, in my case, the device is covered by an M2 gateway operating in the EU868 frequency band. This is crucial as the device needs to communicate with a nearby LoRaWAN gateway that supports the same frequency band.

2. **Gateway Link to LNS:** 
   - It's also essential to confirm that one of these gateways is linked to the LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) that you intend to use. This linkage is vital because the gateway not only acts as a bridge between your Wio-E5 device and the network server but also dictates the path your device's data will take to reach the server.


#### Get Joining Parameters

Assuming you have already configured the ChirpStack network server in the previous section, the next step is to gather the necessary network joining parameters. These parameters are vital to ensure your device can successfully join and access the network.

For a more detailed step-by-step tutorial, please refer to the [Register the Device on LoRaWAN Network Server](/SenseCAP_Indicator_Application_LoRaWAN/#21-configure-the-sensecap-lorawan-gateway) section.

#### Add Device Profile

The Wio-E5 module is defaulted to use the Regional Parameter *V102B*. This information is according to the `4.28.13 VER section` of the [Wio-E5 AT Command Specification](https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/317990687/res/LoRa-E5%20AT%20Command%20Specification_V1.0%20.pdf).

Consequently, we will select `LoRaWAN 1.0.2` as the MAC version and `RP002-1.0.2` for the Regional Parameter revision.

</div>

If you need to use Class C for your device, you can activate it by clicking the following button:

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={680} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Application_Platformio/activate_class_c.png"/>
</div>

<!-- Additional CodeC information will be added here -->

#### Add Application

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={480} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Application_Platformio/add_application.png"/>
</div>

#### Add Device

You should fill in the Device EUI (EUI64) from your Device EUI (EUI64) information, this section is using it.
<!-- TBD -->

If you have changed it, navigate to this [section](#get_eui) to get the `DevAddr`, `DevEui`, `AppEui`.

Alternatively, if you prefer to use a new DevEUi, you can regenerate it and then submit.

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={520} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Application_Platformio/add_device.png"/>
</div>

And get the `AppKey`:

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={500} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Application_Platformio/get_appKey.png"/>
</div>

:::note Device Information
Up to this point, we have obtained the following credentials necessary for the join operation with the LoRaWAN network:

- **DevEUI:** `2cf7f1205100a785`
- **AppKey:** `19aee7bedec56509a9c66a44b7956b6f`

These credentials are essential for the secure registration and communication of your device with the LoRaWAN network.
:::

:::tip Why Don't We Need AppEUI?
In the context of LoRaWAN, DevEUI and AppKey play critical roles in device identification and secure communication. The AppEUI, also known as JoinEUI in LoRaWAN 1.1 and later versions, is typically used during the device joining process to identify the application server instance to which the device should connect. However, in some network configurations or with certain network server implementations, like The Things Network (TTN), the AppEUI may not be essential or is already predefined. This approach simplifies the device setup process by reducing the number of parameters that need to be configured. Therefore, based on the specificities of your network server and its configuration, the explicit use of an AppEUI might not be necessary for the joining process.

## Hands-on

#### Starting a New PlatformIO Project

To begin, you'll create a PlatformIO project. Follow these steps:

1. **Open PlatformIO:** Start by opening the PlatformIO IDE on your computer. 

2. **Create a New Project:** Go to the main menu and select **New Project**. 

Here is an example image showing the new project creation in PlatformIO:

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={500} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Application_Platformio/create_project.png"/>
</div>

For this project, choose **XIAO ESP32S3** as the development board.

Example of project creation for XIAO ESP32S3:

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={500} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Application_Platformio/xiaos3_prj.png"/>
</div>


**Add Necessary Libraries:**

After creating your project, you need to include several libraries that are essential for your project. You can add these libraries to your `platformio.ini` file to let PlatformIO download them automatically:

```ini
[env:seeed_xiao_esp32s3]
platform = espressif32
board = seeed_xiao_esp32s3
framework = arduino
lib_deps = 
    olikraus/U8g2@^2.35.9
    plerup/EspSoftwareSerial@^8.2.0
    https://github.com/dok-net/ghostl # Issue Fix: https://github.com/plerup/espsoftwareserial/issues/305#issuecomment-1880188894
    seeed-studio/Grove Temperature And Humidity Sensor@^2.0.2
    seeed-studio/Grove LED Bar@^1.0.0
    https://github.com/andresoliva/LoRa-E5
```

Once the PlatformIO Library Manager has finished processing your requests, you will be able to see all the libraries that have been added to your project. These libraries are stored in the `.pio/libdeps/seeed_xiao_esp32s3` directory, specific to your selected board, which in this case is the Seeed XIAO ESP32S3.

Here's an image showing how your PlatformIO environment will look after the libraries have been successfully added:

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={500} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Application_Platformio/platformio_libraries.png"/>
</div>

In this directory, you'll find folders for each library you specified in your `platformio.ini` file. These folders contain the necessary files for each library, such as source code, examples, and additional metadata.

This organization makes it easy to manage and update your libraries. PlatformIO automatically handles compatibility and dependency resolution, ensuring that your development process is smooth and efficient. You can also easily update or remove libraries using the PlatformIO Library Manager, keeping your development environment up-to-date with the latest library versions.

#### Join the LoRaWAN Network(Testing)

in this section, we will utilize [andresoliva/LoRa-E5](https://github.com/andresoliva/LoRa-E5) to drive Wio-E5 to join the LoRaWAN network, instead of using AT command by hand.

</div>

<!-- add a flag to build and flash -->

Now we can see there comes the message, and we can see the there is two message out there:

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={500} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Application_Platformio/lorawan_event_package.png"/> 
</div>

it is easy to understand data `00010203040506070809`, which is from `buffer_binary` array.

there also comes data: `SSBhbSBzZW5kaW5nIHRoaXMgbWVzc2FnZSB0byBhIExvUmEgR2F0ZXdheS4=`, what is that mean? as the package is codeded in base64.
we can utilize the [base64 Decode](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/base64_decode.html) to see the string.


<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

</div>

Yes, it's from `buffer_char` array: `I am sending this message to a LoRa Gateway`.

## Troubleshooting

### Q1: Issue with Grove_LED_Bar Library

If you're experiencing issues with the Grove_LED_Bar library, add the following macro definitions at the start of the `Grove_LED_Bar.cpp` file:

```cpp
#include "Grove_LED_Bar.h"
// Add these macros to resolve conflicts
// highlight-start
#define max(a, b) (((a) > (b)) ? (a) : (b))
#define min(a, b) (((a) < (b)) ? (a) : (b))
// highlight-end
```

This code defines the `max` and `min` macros, which can help fix compilation errors related to these functions in the library.
