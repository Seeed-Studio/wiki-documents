# **Overview**
## **LoRaWAN Basics**
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a low-power, long-range wireless communication protocol specifically designed for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It provides long-distance and low-power communication capabilities for IoT devices.The key feature of LoRaWAN includes:

- Long-range communication
- Low power consumption
- Deployed either publicly or privately
- large-scale device connectivity

Due to these characteristics, it is widely applied in smart agriculture,smart city,environmental monitoring and other wireless sensing applications.

# **Get Started**
## **Preparation**
### **hardware**
**Electronic Components**

The kit should include the following electronic components. Please check if they are complete.**    
**
<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Getting_Started/4.jpg" /></div>

Before starting the project, you need to solder the headers on the XIAO board and install the antenna.

**Solder header**

XIAO ESP32S3 is shipped without pin headers by default, you need to prepare your own pin headers and solder it to the corresponding pins of XIAO so that you can connect to the expansion board or sensor.

Due to the miniature size of XIAO ESP32S3, please be careful when soldering headers, do not stick different pins together, and do not stick solder to the shield or other components. Otherwise, it may cause XIAO to short circuit or not work properly, and the consequences caused by this will be borne by the user.
<div align="center"><img width={800} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_LoRaWAN_Starter_Kit/Getting_Started/5.png" /></div>

**Installation of antenna**

On the bottom left of the front of XIAO ESP32S3, there is a separate "WiFi/BT Antenna Connector". In order to get better WiFi/Bluetooth signal, you need to take out the antenna inside the package and install it on the connector.

There is a little trick to the installation of the antenna, if you press down hard on it directly, you will find it very difficult to press and your fingers will hurt! The correct way to install the antenna is to put one side of the antenna connector into the connector block first, then press down a little on the other side, and the antenna will be installed.

Remove the antenna is also the case, do not use brute force to pull the antenna directly, one side of the force to lift, the antenna is easy to take off.
