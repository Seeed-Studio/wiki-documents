OpenWrt is an open-source Linux operating system which runs on embedded devices/ routers. It offers more features, performance and security than a traditional router. It has a filesystem thatâ€™s fully writable and includes a package management system. You can make use of these packages to suit your applications in various ways.

By using OpenWrt you can have various features such as:

- Increase overall network performance when multiple devices are connected
- Share files between devices via an external storage drive connected directly to the router
- Increase network security
- Run a BitTorrent client from the router
- Connect a printer directly to the router to create a networked printer
- Limit bandwidth usage of a particular device in the network
- Active queue management
- Real time network monitoring
- Create Dynamic DNS
- Set Up a VPN client or server

Now let's dive into using OpenWrt on Dual Gigabit Ethernet Carrier Board for Raspberry Pi CM4 and ODYSSEY - X86J4125.

#### Dual Gigabit Ethernet Ports Connection

Once OpenWrt is finished flashing onto Dual Gigabit Ethernet Carrier Board for Raspberry Pi CM4, you can connect Ethernet cables to the board as follows:

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/OpenWrt/cm4-ports-2.png" alt="pir" width="600" height="auto"/></p>

The OpenWrt image has already included the necessary network configurations for the dual Gigabit ports to work out-of-the-box, so that you don't have to configure them by yourself. However, here is an explanation of how the 2 ports are configured.

One port is configured as a **LAN interface** and the other as a **WAN interface**. The WAN interface is the one which can be connected to the internet and it is configured as a **DHCP client**. On the other hand, the LAN interface is the one which can be connected to the client devices and it is configured as a **DHCP server**.

Here the LAN interface is configured so that it has a static IP address of **192.168.2.1**. However, if you connect this OpenWrt router to another router with default gateway IP of 192.168.2.1, you might want to change the IP address on the LAN interface or otherwise OpenWrt will have IP conflict. Please follow the [FAQ](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/OpenWrt-Getting-Started/#q1-what-if-i-connect-the-openwrt-router-to-my-exisiting-router-which-has-a-default-gateway-ip-of-19216821) below to learn more!

### ODYSSEY - X86J4125

Next we will explain how to install and set up OpenWrt on ODYSSEY - X86J4125
