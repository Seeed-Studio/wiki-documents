## How to Get Started With Arduino

### Install the Arduino IDE

- **Arduino IDE** is an integrated development environment for Arduino, which is used for single-chip microcomputer software programming, downloading, testing and so on.
- Download and Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for your desired operating system here.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_Stalker_V3_1/images/Download_IDE.png)



### Install the USB driver

- Arduino connects to the PC via a USB cable. The USB driver depends on the type of USB chip you're using on your Arduino. *Note: USB chips are usually printed on the back of the development board.*

  - Download the [CP2102 USB Driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers). **Note:** Download according to your OS.
  - After the driver installation is completed, connect Arduino to the USB port of PC with a USB cable. 
      - **For Windows users:** You can see it in `My Computer` -> `Properties` -> `Hardware` -> `Device Management`. A `COM` will appear.
      - **For Mac OS users:** You can navigate to `Ô£ø` on the top left corner, and choose `About this Mac` -> `System Report...` -> `USB`. A CP2102 USB Driver should appear.
  - If the driver is not installed, or if the driver is installed incorrectly (not matching the chip model), it will appear as an "unknown device" in the device manager. At this point, the driver should be reinstalled.



### Start the Arduino IDE

1.Open the **Arduino IDE** on your PC.
2.Click on `Tools` -> `Board`-> `Arduino AVR Boards`-> `Arduino Uno` to select the correct Development Board Model. Select **Arduino Uno** as Board.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/uno_board.jpg)

3.Click `Tools` -> `Port` to select the correct Port (the Serial Port showed in Device Manager in the previous step). In this case, `COM11` is selected. **For Mac OS users**, it should be `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART`.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/port.jpg)


4.Create a new Arduino file and name it `Hello.ino`, then copy the following code into it:

```Cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // initializes the serial port with a baud rate of 9600
}
void loop() {
  Serial.println("hello, world"); // prints a string to a serial port
  delay(1000); //delay of 1 second
}
```

5.In the upper left corner of the Arduino IDE, there are two buttons, **Verify and Upload**. First, press the Verify button(‚úì) to compile. After the compilation is successful, press the upload button(‚Üí).

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/func.png)

6.Navigate to `Tools` -> `Serial Monitor`, or click the **Serial Monitor** in the upper right corner(Magnifier Symbol), you can see the program running results:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/print.png)

**Note:** If you installed the portable Arduino IDE from our USB Drive, you can find all the module demos in the **Files** -> **Sketch Book**, as well as all the module libraries, are pre-installed with Arduino IDE!

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/Sketchbook.png)

**Note:**
        All modules are pre-wired on a single circuit board, so no cables and soldering are needed. However, if you break out the modules and want to connect them with Grove  cables, please kindly check the Breakout Guide.


## Lesson Guide

### Lesson 1: Blinking with the LED

We have completed the output "Hello world" program. Now let's learn how to light the LED module. We know the three basic components of a control system: Input, Control, and Output. But lighting up LED uses only the output, not the input. Seeeduino is the control unit, the LED module is the output unit and the output signal is a digital signal.

Background Information:


- **What is Digital Signal**

**Digital signal:** Digital signal refers to the value of the amplitude is discrete, the amplitude is limited to a finite number of values. In our controller, the digital signal has two states: LOW(0V) for 0; HIGH(5V) for 1. So sending a HIGH signal to LED can light it up.

![Alt text](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/digital.png)



Components Involved
    1. Seeeduino Lotus
    2. Grove LED
    3. Grove Cable(If Broken out)

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/LED.png)


Hardware connection
    - **Module connection**
        - Default connection by PCB stamp hole.
    - Connect the Seeeduino to the computer through the USB cable.


-Software Code

    - Open Arduino IDE.
    - Copy the following code, click Verify to check for syntax errors. Verify that there are no errors, and you can upload the code.

```Cpp
//LED Blink
//The LED will turn on for one second and then turn off for one second
int ledPin = 4;
void setup() {
    pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    delay(1000);
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    delay(1000);
}
```





Code Analysis


```cpp
setup(){
}
```

The `setup()` function is called when a sketch starts. Use it to initialize variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc. The `setup()` function will only run once, after each powerup or reset of the Arduino board.

```cpp
loop(){
}
```

After creating a `setup()` function, which initializes and sets the initial values, the `loop()` function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond. Use it to actively control the Arduino board.

```cpp
int ledPin = 4;
```

**Description:**

Converts a value to the int data type.

**Syntax:**

int(**x**) or (int)**x** (C-style type conversion)

**Parameters:**

**x**: a value. Allowed data types: any type.

Assigned an `int` type 4 to variable named ledPin.

```cpp
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
```

**Description:**

Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output. See the Digital Pins page for details on the functionality of the pins.

As of Arduino 1.0.1, it is possible to enable the internal pull-up resistors with the mode `INPUT_PULLUP`. Additionally, the `INPUT` mode explicitly disables the internal pullups.

**Syntax:**

pinMode(**pin, mode**)

**Parameters:**

**pin**: the Arduino pin number to set the mode of.

**mode**: `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, or `INPUT_PULLUP`.

Setting ledPin to the output mode.

```cpp
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
```

**Description:**

Write a `HIGH` or a `LOW` value to a digital pin.

If the pin has been configured as an OUTPUT with pinMode(), its voltage will be set to the corresponding value: 5V (or 3.3V on 3.3V boards) for `HIGH`, 0V (ground) for `LOW`.

If the pin is configured as an INPUT, digitalWrite() will enable (HIGH) or disable (LOW) the internal pullup on the input pin. It is recommended to set the pinMode() to `INPUT_PULLUP` to enable the internal pull-up resistor. See the Digital Pins tutorial for more information.

If you do not set the pinMode() to OUTPUT, and connect an LED to a pin, when calling digitalWrite(HIGH), the LED may appear dim. Without explicitly setting pinMode(), digitalWrite() will have enabled the internal pull-up resistor, which acts as a large current-limiting resistor.

**Syntax:**

digitalWrite(**pin, value**)

**Parameters:**

**pin**: the Arduino pin number.

**value**: `HIGH` or `LOW`.

When we set the ledPin as output, HIGH means sending high level to the pin, LED turns on.

```cpp
digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
```

When we set the led as output, low stands for sending low level to the pin, LED turns off.

```cpp
delay(1000);
```

**Description:**

Pauses the program for the amount of time (in milliseconds) specified as a parameter. (There are 1000 milliseconds in a second.)

**Syntax:**

delay(**ms**)

**Parameters:** 

**ms**: the number of milliseconds to pause. Allowed data types: unsigned long.

Delay the program by 1000ms(1s).

**Demo Effect and Serial Print Result:**

The LED module will be 1 second on and 1 second off.

**LED Brightness Adjustment:**

  <br />
</div>


On the Grove LED module, there is a **variable resistor that can be adjusted using a screw driver.** Twist it to make the LED light up brighter!


Breakout Guide


If modules are broken out from the board. Use a Grove cable to connect the **Grove LED** to Seeeduino Lotus's digital interface **D4**.  





### Lesson 2: Pressing Button to Light Up LED

The first thing we need to know is that the input of the button is a digital signal, and there are only two states, 0 or 1, so we can control the output based on those two states.

- **Practice:** Use button to turn ON and OFF the LED module

Components Involved

    1. Seeeduino Lotus
    2. Grove LED
    3. Grove Button
    4. Grove Cables(If broken out)

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/Button.png)

Hardware connection

    - **Module connection:**
        - Default connection by PCB stamp hole.
    - The Seeeduino is then connected to the computer via a USB cable.

- **Hardware analysis**:
    - Input: Button
    - Control: Seeeduino
    - Output: LED module

Both the sensor and the LED use digital signals, so they should be connected to digital interfaces.

- **Software code**:
    - Open Arduino IDE.
    - Copy the following code, click Verify to check for syntax errors. Verify that there are no errors, and you can upload the code.

```Cpp
//Button to turn ON/OFF LED
//Constants won't change. They're used here to set pin numbers:
const int buttonPin = 6;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin =  4;      // the number of the LED pin

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
}
```



Code Analysis


```cpp
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
```

Define LED as the output unit.

```cpp
pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
```
  
Define button as the input unit.



```cpp
buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
```

**Description:**

Reads the value from a specified digital pin, either `HIGH` or `LOW`.

**Syntax:**

digitalRead(**pin**)

**Parameters:**

**pin**: the Arduino `pin` number you want to read

This function is used to read the states of digital pins, either HIGH or LOW. When the button is pressed, the state is HIGH, otherwise is LOW.

```cpp
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
}
```

**Description:**

The if‚Ä¶‚Äãelse allows greater control over the flow of code than the basic if statement, by allowing multiple tests to be grouped. An else clause (if at all exists) will be executed if the condition in the if statement results in false. The else can proceed another if test, so that multiple, mutually exclusive tests can be run at the same time.

Each test will proceed to the next one until a true test is encountered. When a true test is found, its associated block of code is run, and the program then skips to the line following the entire if/else construction. If no test proves to be true, the default else block is executed, if one is present, and sets the default behaviour.

Note that an else if block may be used with or without a terminating else block and vice versa. An unlimited number of such else if branches are allowed.



**Syntax:**

```cpp
if (condition1) {
  // do Thing A
}
else if (condition2) {
  // do Thing B
}
else {
  // do Thing C
}
```

The usage of the statement is: if the logical expression in parentheses is true, execute the statement in curly braces after **if**, if not, execute the statement in curly braces after the **else**. If the state of the button is high, the LED pin outputs a high level and turn the LED on, else turn LED off.

**Demo Effect and Serial Print Result:**

Pressing the button will turn the LED module on.

Breakout Guide

Use a Grove cable to connect the Grove LED to Seeeduino Lotus's digital interface **D4**. Connect the Grove Button to digital interface **D6**.





### Lesson 3: Controlling the Frequency of the Blink

In the last section, we studied that button only has two states, ON/OFF state corresponding 0V and 5V, but in practice, we often counter the need for many states, not just 0V and 5V. Then you need to use Analog Signal! Rotary Potentiometer is a classic example that uses an analog signal.

Background Information:

- **What is Analog Signal**

**Analog signals:** Signals vary continuously in time and value, and the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the signal changes continuously at any time, such as the current broadcast sound signal, or image signal, etc. The analog signal has sine wave and triangle wave and so on. The analog pins of your microcontroller can have between 0V and 5V is mapped to a range between 0 and 1023 where 1023 is mapped as 5V and 512 is mapped as 2.5v and etc.

![Alt text](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/analog.png)



Components Involved
    1. Seeeduino Lotus
    2. Grove LED
    3. Grove Rotary Switch
    4. Grove Cables(If broken out)

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/rotary.png)



Hardware connection
    - **Module connection:**
        - Default connection by PCB stamp hole.
    - The Seeeduino is then connected to the computer via a USB cable.

- **Hardware analysis:**

    - Input: Rotary Potentiometer
    - Control: Seeeduino Lotus
    - Output: LED module

The input is an analog signal, so it is connected to the analog signal interface, the LED module is connected to the digital signal interface.


Software 

    - Open Arduino IDE.
    - Copy the following code, click Verify to check for syntax errors. Verify that there are no errors, and you can upload the code.

```Cpp
//Rotary controls LED
int rotaryPin = A0;    // select the input pin for the rotary
int ledPin = 4;      // select the pin for the LED
int rotaryValue = 0;  // variable to store the value coming from the rotary

void setup() {
  // declare the ledPin as an OUTPUT:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(rotaryPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // read the value from the sensor:
  rotaryValue = analogRead(rotaryPin);
  // turn the ledPin on
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  // stop the program for <sensorValue> milliseconds:
  delay(rotaryValue);
  // turn the ledPin off:
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  // stop the program for for <sensorValue> milliseconds:
  delay(rotaryValue);
}
```



Code Analysis

```cpp
int rotaryPin = A0;    // select the input pin for the rotary
int ledPin = 4;      // select the pin for the LED
```
**Description:**

You may find that we define rotatePin and ledPin in different ways. This is because Rotary Potentiometer generates an analog signal, and the LED is controlled by a digital signal.

To **define for Analog Pin**, use A + the number of the Pin (For Example here `A0`).

To **define for Digital Pin**, use just the number of the pin (For Example here `4`).

```cpp
rotaryValue = analogRead(rotaryPin);
```

**Description:**

Reads the value from the specified analog pin. Arduino boards contain a multichannel, 10-bit analog to digital converter. This means that it will map input voltages between 0 and the operating voltage(5V or 3.3V) into integer values between 0 and 1023. On an Arduino UNO, for example, this yields a resolution between readings of: 5 volts / 1024 units or, 0.0049 volts (4.9 mV) per unit.

**Syntax:**

analogRead(**pin**)

**Parameters:**

**pin**: the name of the analog input pin to read from (A0 to A5 on most boards).

**Returns:** The analog reading on the pin. Although it is limited to the resolution of the analog to digital converter (0-1023 for 10 bits or 0-4095 for 12 bits). Data type: int.

This function is used to read the value of Analog pins(the rotary sensor position), the range of values is: 0 ~ 1023.

```cpp
delay(rotaryValue);
```

Delay function, The millisecond duration of the delay is the value in parentheses. Because the value is the value of the analog signal of the knob pin being read, so the delay time can be controlled by the knob.

**Demo Effect and Serial Print Result:**

Turning the Potentiometer will change the frequency of LED flickering.

Breakout Guide

Use a Grove cable to connect LED to Seeeduino Lotus's digital interface **D4**, and a Grove cable to connect the Grove Rotary Switch to analog signal interface **A0**.


### Lesson 4: Making the Buzzer go BEEP

Just like the LED module, Buzzer is also an output module, instead of lighting up it produces a beep sound. This can be used for many situations for indication purposes.Let's learn how to generate sound using the buzzer!

Background Information:

- **What is the difference between Active and Passive Buzzer**

 There are two types of buzzers, one is **active** and the other is **passive**. Both active and passive buzzers are used to make sound to electronics.

  The **active buzzer** has an internal oscillation source that makes the buzzer sound whenever power is applied. Active buzzers are widely used in computers, printers, copiers, alarms, electronic toys, car electronics, telephones, timers and other electronic product sounding devices.

  A **passive buzzer** has no internal source of oscillation and needs to be driven by **a square wave** and **a different frequency**. It acts like an electromagnetic speaker, and the changing input signal produces sound, rather than a tone automatically.

 <div align="center"><img width={500} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/buzzer-ap.jpg" /></div>


In this kit, the **Grove-Buzzer is a passive buzzer** so that it needs an AC signal to control it. This then leads to the next question, how to generate Square Wave(AC signals) with Arduino! Well, an easy way is to use PWM.

- **What is PWM**

**Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM**, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means. Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between full on (5 Volts) and off (0 Volts) by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off. The duration of "on time" is called the pulse width. To get varying analog values, you change, or modulate, that pulse width. If you repeat this on-off pattern fast enough, the result is as if the signal is a steady voltage between 0 and 5v as a AC signal. *Reference: [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/PWM)*. This PWM signal can then be used to control the passive buzzer with ease.

To generate PWM signals in Arduino, you can use **`analogWrite()`**, in contrast to using `digitalWrite()` to generate DC signals.

There are six digital pins on your Seeeduino that are marked with the symbol ‚Äú~‚Äù, which means they can send out a PWM signal : 3,5,6,9,10,11. They are celled PWM pins.

Components Involved

    1. Seeeduino Lotus
    2. Grove Buzzer
    3. Grove Cable(If Broken out)

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/Buzzer.png)



Hardware connection

    - **Module connection**
        - Default connection by PCB stamp hole.
    - Connect the Seeeduino to the computer through the USB cable.

Software Code

    - Open Arduino IDE.
    - Copy the following code, click Verify to check for syntax errors. Verify that there are no errors, and you can upload the code.

```Cpp
int BuzzerPin = 5;

void setup() {
  pinMode(BuzzerPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  analogWrite(BuzzerPin, 128);
  delay(1000);
  analogWrite(BuzzerPin, 0);
  delay(0);
}
```

Code Analysis

```cpp
analogWrite(BuzzerPin, 128);
```

**Description:**

Writes an analog value (PWM wave) to a pin. Can be used to light a LED at varying brightnesses or drive a motor at various speeds. After a call to analogWrite(), the pin will generate a steady rectangular wave of the specified duty cycle until the next call to analogWrite() (or a call to digitalRead() or digitalWrite()) on the same pin.

**Syntax:**

analogWrite(**pin, value**)

**Parameters:**

**pin**: the Arduino `pin` to write to. Allowed data types: int. 

**value**: the duty cycle: between `0` (always off) and `255` (always on). Allowed data types: int.

Writes an analog value (PWM wave) to the Buzzer.

**Demo Effect and Serial Print Result:**

The Buzzer beeps.

Breakout Guide

Use a Grove cable to connect the Grove Buzzer to Seeeduino Lotus's digital interface **D5**.

-----

PWM Usage

Now that we have learned the use of PWM, in addition to using PWM to control the passive buzzer, we can also use PWM to control the speed of the motor and **the brightness of the LED lights** and etc.

As the diagram indicates below, use `analogWrite()` to generate PWM waves, the higher the percentage of Duty Cycle, the brighter the LED.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/PWM-LED.png" /></div>


However, the LED Module on the Grove Beginner Kit cannot be directly controlled by PWM, because the LED module is connected to D4, and as mentioned above, the PWM pins are 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, and pin 4 is not a PWM pin. If you want to control the LED with PWM, you need to pull it down and use the Grove cable to connect to the Grove port with PWM function.

For example, let's connect **Grove-LED to D3 using a Grove cable**:

!!!Note
    D3 is also inter-connected to the Grove-Temperature & Humidity Sensor, and therefore this example cannot be used with Grove-Temperature & Humidity Sensor together.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/pwmled-connect.png" /></div>

```cpp
int LED = 3; // Cable connection from LED to D3
int Potentiometer = A0;

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(Potentiometer, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int potentioValue, Value;
  potentioValue = analogRead(Potentiometer);
  Value = map(potentioValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255); //Mapping potentiometer value to PWM signal value
  analogWrite(LED, Value);
}
```

**Compile and upload** the code you should be able to twist and adjust the LED brightness using PWM signals!

Code Analysis

```cpp
Value = map(potentioValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
```

**Description:**

Re-maps a number from one range to another. That is, a value of **fromLow** would get mapped to **toLow**, a value of **fromHigh** to **toHigh**, values in-between to values in-between, etc.

Does not constrain values to within the range, because out-of-range values are sometimes intended and useful. The `constrain()` function may be used either before or after this function, if limits to the ranges are desired.

Note that the "lower bounds" of either range may be larger or smaller than the "upper bounds" so the `map()` function may be used to reverse a range of numbers, for example

**y = map(x, 1, 50, 50, 1);**

The function also handles negative numbers well, so that this example

**y = map(x, 1, 50, 50, -100);**

is also valid and works well.

The map() function uses integer math so will not generate fractions, when the math might indicate that it should do so. Fractional remainders are truncated and are not rounded or averaged.

**Syntax:**

map(**value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh**)

**Parameters:**

**value**: the number to map.

**fromLow**: the lower bound of the value‚Äôs current range.

**fromHigh**: the upper bound of the value‚Äôs current range.

**toLow**: the lower bound of the value‚Äôs target range.

**toHigh**: the upper bound of the value‚Äôs target range.

Mapping Potentiometer sensor analog signal(0 to 1023)to the loudness of Light(0 to 255).

**Demo Effect and Serial Print Result:**

Adjust the potentiometer to adjust the LED brightness.

All in all, when you want to use the PWM function, make sure to select those pins with a "~" symbol in front of their names.

### Lesson 5:  Making an Light Induct LED

The light sensor contains a photosensitive resistor to measure the intensity of light. The resistance of the photosensitive resistor decreases with the increase of light intensity. The LED will light up if the surrounding is dark, and stays off if the surrounding is bright.

In the following sections, we will use Serial Monitor to observe results from our sensors so here comes the brief introduction!

Background Information:

- **What is Serial Monitor**

Serial Monitor is a useful tool to observe results on Arduino, it can be very useful in terms of printing results from the sensors or debugging in general. You can also send data back to the controller via the serial monitor to do certain tasks! Note: Make sure the Serial data transfer match with the code.

    - Copy the following code, click Verify to check for syntax errors. Verify that there are no errors, and you can upload the code.

```Cpp
// Light Switch
int sensorpin = A6; // Analog input pin that the sensor is attached to
int ledPin = 4;    // LED port
int sensorValue = 0;        // value read from the port
int outputValue = 0;        // value output to the PWM (analog out)

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(sensorpin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the analog in value:
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorpin);

  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  if (sensorValue < 200) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  }
  else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }

  delay(200);
}
```

You can also see the light intensity readings from the **Serial Monitor**, navigate to **Tools** -> **Serial Monitor**.

Code Analysis

```cpp
Serial.begin(9600);
```

**Description:**

Sets the data rate in bits per second (baud) for serial data transmission. For communicating with Serial Monitor, make sure to use one of the baud rates listed in the menu at the bottom right corner of its screen. You can, however, specify other rates - for example, to communicate over pins 0 and 1 with a component that requires a particular baud rate.

An optional second argument configures the data, parity, and stop bits. The default is 8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit.

The software running on the computer communicates with the development board, and the baud rate is 9600.

**Syntax:**

Serial.begin(**speed**)

**Parameters:**

**speed**: Speed of Serial communication. i.e `9600`, `115200` and etc.

Set the Serial baud rate to 9600.

```cpp
Serial.println(sensorValue);
```

**Description:**

Prints data to the serial port as human-readable ASCII text followed by a carriage return character (ASCII 13, or '\r') and a newline character (ASCII 10, or '\n'). This command takes the same forms as Serial.print().

**Syntax:**

Serial.println(**val**) or Serial.println(**val**, **format**)

**Parameters:** 

**val**: the value to print. Allowed data types: any data type.

**format**: specifies the number base (for integral data types) or the number of decimal places (for floating point types).

Serial port print the Light sensor‚Äôs value.  So you open the **serial monitor** on the IDE interface, and you see the value of the output sensor.

**Demo Effect and Serial Print Result:**

The LED module will light up if it's dark and stay off if it's bright.

Breakout Guide

### Lesson 6: Sound Sensitive LED Light

The sound sensor can detect the sound intensity of the environment, and its output is also simulated. I'm sure you've all been exposed to the sound control lights, but now we can do one ourselves, and with the basics, this experiment will be easy for you. Here used Serial Plotter to visualize results.

Background Information:

- **What is Serial Plotter**

Serial Plotter is similar to Serial Monitor, allowing you to natively graph serial data from your Arduino to your computer in real-time. This is very useful when data needs to be visualized.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/SerialPlotter.png)

You can open the Serial Plotter by clicking **Tools** -> **Serial Plotter**.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/serialplot.jpg)



- **Practice:** The LED lights light up when the sound is made. When there is no sound and it is very quiet, the LED lights go off.

Components Involved

    1. Seeeduino Lotus
    2. Grove LED
    3. Grove Sound Sensor
    4. Grove cable(If broken out)

Hardware connection

    - **Module connection:**
        - Default connection by PCB stamp hole.
    - The Seeeduino is then connected to the computer via a USB cable.


Software Code

    - Open Arduino IDE.
    - Copy the following code, click Verify to check for syntax errors. Verify that there are no errors, and you can upload the code.

```Cpp
//Sound Control Light
int soundPin = A2; // Analog sound sensor is to be attached to analog
int ledPin = 4; // Digital LED is to be attached to digital
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(soundPin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop(){
  int soundState = analogRead(soundPin); // Read sound sensor‚Äôs value
  Serial.println(soundState);
  // if the sound sensor‚Äôs value is greater than 400, the light will be on.
  //Otherwise, the light will be turned off
  if (soundState > 400) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    delay(100);
  }else{
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
}
```

You can also see the light intensity readings from the **Serial Plotter**, navigate to **Tools** -> **Serial Plotter**.

**Note: You can also adjust the value according to your surrounding light intensity.**



Code Analysis

```cpp
Serial.begin(9600);
```

The software running on the computer communicates with the development board, and the baud rate is 9600.

```cpp
Serial.print(" ");
```

This function is used to output data from the serial port, the output is what is contained in the double quotation marks.

```cpp
Serial.println( );
```

This statement is similar to the one above, except that **serial.println** has a newline return.



```cpp
Serial.println(soundState);
```

Serial port print the sound sensor‚Äôs value.  So you open the **serial monitor** on the IDE interface, and you see the value of the output sensor.

**Demo Effect and Serial Print Result:**

The LED module will light up if the surrounding is loud enough.

### Lesson 7: Displaying Data on OLED

OLED Display can be used for many situations, where you could use it to visualize sensor readings!

Background Information:

- **What is Arduino Libraries**

The Arduino environment can be extended through the use of libraries, just like most other programming platforms. Libraries provide extra functionalities for use in sketches, i.e. working with specific hardware or manipulating data. To use a library in a sketch, select it from **Sketch** ->**Include Library**.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/zip.jpg)

For more information, please also visit [How to install Arduino Libraries](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/How_to_install_Arduino_Library/).



Components Involved

    1. Seeeduino Lotus
    2. Grove OLED
    3. Grove cable(If broken out)

// U8X8_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_SW_I2C u8x8(/* clock=*/ SCL, /* data=*/ SDA, /* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE);   // OLEDs without Reset of the Display

void setup(void) {
  //u8x8.setBusClock(100000);  // If you breakout other modules, please enable this line
  u8x8.begin();
  u8x8.setFlipMode(1);
}

void loop(void) {
  u8x8.setFont(u8x8_font_chroma48medium8_r);
  u8x8.setCursor(0, 0);
  u8x8.print("Hello World!");
}
```

!!!Attention
  If you breakout all the modules and use the Grove OLED separately, you may find it won't work with this code. If you encounter such a problem, please refer to the end of this section: Breakout Guide.


- **Code analysis**

```cpp
#include <>
```

**Description:**

`#include` is used to include outside libraries in your sketch. This gives the programmer access to a large group of standard C libraries (groups of pre-made functions), and also libraries written especially for Arduino.

Note that `#include`, similar to `#define`, has no semicolon terminator, and the compiler will yield cryptic error messages if you add one.

```cpp
#include <U8x8lib.h>
```

**#include** is an instruction that introduces a header file. Here we use the U8x8lib.h library.

```cpp
U8X8_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_HW_I2C u8x8(/* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE);  
```

**Note**
  
If you break out other modules and only use OLED, you have to software I2C:

```CPP
// U8X8_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_HW_I2C u8x8(/* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE);  

U8X8_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_SW_I2C u8x8(/* clock=*/ SCL, /* data=*/ SDA, /* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE); 
```


**Description:**

Once the object is declared, you can use functions from the library.

```cpp
u8x8.begin();
```

**Description:**

Simplified setup procedure of the display for the Arduino environment. See the setup guide for the selection of a suitable U8g2 constructor.

**Syntax:**

u8x8.begin()

Initialize the u8g2 library

```cpp
u8x8.setFlipMode(1);
```

**Description:**

Some displays support a 180-degree rotation of the internal frame buffer. This hardware feature can be controlled with this procedure. Important: Redraw the complete display after changing the flip mode. Best is to clear the display first, then change the flip mode and finally redraw the content. Results will be undefined for any existing content on the screen.

**Syntax:**

u8x8.setFlipMode(**mode**)

**Parameters:**

**mode**: `0` or `1`

Flips the display 180 degrees.

```cpp
u8x8.setCursor();
```

**Description:**

Define the cursor for the print function. Any output of the print function will start at this position.

**Syntax:**

u8x8.setCursor(**x, y**)

**Parameters:**

**x, y**: Column/row position for the cursor of the print function.

Sets the draw cursor position.

```cpp
u8x8.setFont()
```

**Description:** 

Define a u8x8 font for the glyph and string drawing functions.

**Syntax:**

u8x8.setFont(**font_8x8**)

Set the font for display.

```cpp
u8x8.print();
```

Draw the content on the OLED.

**Demo Effect and Serial Print Result:**

Prints Hello World onto the OLED Display.

**U8g2 Library Reference**

If you want to more information about U8g2 library, please refer to [here](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/u8g2reference).

Breakout Guide

Use Grove cable to connect the OLED to Seeeduino Lotus's **I2C** interface (Note: I2C's default address is 0x78).

!!!Note 
    - If you breakout other modoule to use the OLED and it do not work, or you want to use fastest OLED I2C (default: 40KHZ), please follow this instrcution:

  Click "This PC" -> Documents -> Arduino -> libraries -> U8g2 -> src -> U8x8lib.cpp -> Sliding to 1334 line -> delete or disable this line -> save the file.

  ```CPP
  Wire.setClock(u8x8->bus_clock);   // just delete or disable this line
  ```
  

 Or you can set the bus lock to 100000 then add in the setup().
```CPP
void setup(void) {
  u8x8.setBusClock(100000); //  it for limit the I2C bus clock
  u8x8.begin();
  u8x8.setFlipMode(1);
}
```

### Lesson 8: Detecting Surrounding Temperature & Humidity

Have you ever wondered about the temperature and humidity of your surroundings? Want to know the exact number? Want to wear a skirt or coat today depending on the temperature? Let's make a temperature meter!

Background Information:

- **What is Protocol Signal (I2C)**

**Protocol signal:** the protocol signal we use is I2C, so here is a brief introduction to I2C. I2C bus just needs two wires in the transmission of information connection between the devices: the SDA (Serial Data Line) and SCL (Serial Clock Line).

These two lines are bidirectional I/O lines, the main component used to start the bus transfer data, and generate the clock to open transmission device, any devices that are addressing at this time is considered from the device.

The relationship between master and slave(sender and receiver) on the bus is not constant but depends on the direction of data transmission. If the host wants to send data to the slave device, the host first addresses the slave device, then actively sends data to the slave device, and finally terminates the data transmission by the host. If the host is to receive data from the slave, the slave is first addressed by the master.

The host then receives the data sent from the device, and the host terminates the receiving process. In this case. The host is responsible for generating the timing clock and terminating the data transfer.



- **Practice:** Let your OLED Display display the current ambient temperature and humidity.

### Project 2: Make an intelligent sound-light induction desk lamp

- **Project description:** as the name implies, this project is to make a small lamp controlled by Sound and Light. We need to use the LED module as output. Light sensor and sound sensor are used for input signals. In this way, you can achieve the function of the smart desk lamp: if the surrounding sound level is above certain pre-set value, then the LED light up, or if the surrounding light intensity is below certain value, the LED module also light up.



Components Involved

    1. Seeeduino Lotus
    2. Grove LED
    3. Light Sensor
    4. Sound Sensor
    5. Grove cable(If broken out)

Hardware connection

    - **Module connection:**
        - Default connection by PCB stamp hole.
    - The Seeeduino is then connected to the computer via a USB cable.


Software Code

    - Open Arduino IDE.
    - Copy the following code, click Verify to check for syntax errors. Verify that there are no errors, and you can upload the code.

```Cpp
//light Induction Desk Lamp
int soundPin = A2; // Analog sound sensor is to be attached to analog
int lightPin = A6; //Analog light sensor is to be attached to analog
int ledPin = 4; // Digital LED is to be attached to digital

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(lightPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(soundPin, INPUT);
}

void loop(){
  int soundState = analogRead(soundPin); // Read sound sensor‚Äôs value
  int lightState = analogRead(lightPin); // Read light sensor‚Äôs value
  // if the sound sensor's value is greater than 500 or the sound sensor's is less than 200, the light will be on.
  //Otherwise, the light will be turned off
if (soundState > 500 || lightState < 200) {
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  delay(500); //You can add the "//" to remove the delay
}else{
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
}
}
```
Code Analysis

```cpp
if (soundState > 500 || lightState < 200) {
  ...
}
```

In parentheses is a logical expression. Both **&&** and **||** are commonly used in logical expressions. The common usage is **if (expression 1 || expression 2)** and **if (expression 1 && expression 2)**.

**||** represents "**or**", satisfies one of them, the whole expression is true, and satisfies the condition of the if judgment.

**&&** means "**and**", the statement in if{} is executed only if all expressions in parentheses are true.

**Demo Effect and Serial Print Result:**

If the surrounding sound is loud enough or light intensity is low, the LED module will light up more intensity.

Breakout Guide

Connect the Grove LED to Seeeduino Lotus's digital signal interface **D4**, Connect the Light Sensor to Seeeduino Lotus's analog signal interface **A1**. Connect the Sound Sensor to Seeeduino Lotus's analog signal interface **A2** using a Grove cable.





## Make Your Own Modules & Boards

After this period of study, you already have a systematic understanding of Arduino and open-source hardware, so why not go further and try to make your own module or development board?

### EDA

To design your own board, you will need to design your own module's schematics, which requires an EDA tool to do so. Here recommends an open-source EDA software.

- **KiCAD**

[KiCad](https://www.kicad-pcb.org/) is a free software suite for electronic design automation. It facilitates the design of schematics for electronic circuits and their conversion to PCB designs. It features an integrated environment for schematic capture and PCB layout design. The programs handle Schematic Capture and PCB Layout with Gerber output. The suite runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS and is licensed under GNU GPL v3.

- **Upverter**

If you don‚Äôt want to work on schematic or layout yourself, but you want to convert your prototype based on Seeed‚Äôs modules into an integrated product, we highly recommend you to try Upverter.

Please visit the [**Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino Upverter Guide**](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Beginner-Kit-for-Arduino-Upverter-Guide/) for more information.

### PCB Services

After you‚Äôre done with your design, check out the [Seeed Fusion PCBA service](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html), which can help translate your designs into an actual functioning device.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/Fusion.png)

Seeed Studio has its very own [Open Parts Library (OPL)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/opl.html) which is a collection of over 10,000 commonly used components specifically sourced for the Seeed Fusion PCBA Service. To speed up the process of PCB design, Seeed is building the component libraries for KiCad and Eagle. When all components are sourced from Seeed‚Äôs PCBA OPL and used with the [Seeed Fusion PCB Assembly (PCBA) service](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html), the entire PCBA production time can be reduced from 20 working days to a mere 7 days.

## FAQ

### 1. How to remove the individual electronic modules for use?
![image.png](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/remove1.jpg)

Looking closely at the Grove Beginner Kit For Arduino you will see that there are 3 small holes between each individual module and the backplane. All you need to do is cut the PCB backplane around the module from the small holes using a pair of diagonal pliers.

![image.png](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Beginner-Kit-For-Arduino/img/remove2.jpg)

---

**Note: carefully cut along the periphery of the small hole, do not cut to the small hole (to prevent internal wiring short circuit and thus damage the module); if you accidentally cut to the small hole, please use a knife to clean the small hole to prevent short circuit**
