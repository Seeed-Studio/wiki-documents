OK, let's check out what the Tick Tock Shield is capable of.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Starter_Shield_EN/img/Complete_Tick_Shield.JPG)

### Preparation: Install the Hardware and Software  

1. Plug Tick Tock Shield onto Arduino board. Connect Arduino to PC via USB cable as show below.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Starter_Shield_EN/img/Connect_Tick_Shield.jpg)

2. Download [Starter Shield Library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Starter_Shield_Libraries)

3. Unzip and put them in the libraries file of Arduino IDE by the path: ..\arduino-1.0.1\libraries.

**Note**

<dl><dd>1) Libraries MsTimer2 and Timerone are packed in Tick Tock Shield Library we prvide above. We download them from Arduino website. If you already have them in your libraries file, them no need to add them once again.

</dd><dd>2) Through all 7 demos in Tick Tock Shield library, we define:

<dl><dd><dl><dd>K3 - menu key
</dd><dd>K2 - increase key
</dd><dd>K1 - decrease key
</dd><dd>D4 - LED_CLOCK_ADJUST

</dd><dd>D3 - LED_ALARM_ADJUST

</dd><dd>D2 - LED_ALARM_ENABLE

</dd><dd>D1 - LED_BRIGHT_ADJUST

</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>
</dd></dl>

### Getting Started: Fun With Tick Tock Shield  

From easy to difficult, we prepared a series of demos for you to explore what your Tick Tock Shield is capable of. Follow me to have fun with it.

**Demo 1: Sweep The LEDs**

<dl><dd>1. This demo only involves the usage of the most basic actuator - LEDs.

</dd><dd>2. Restart the Arduino IDE. Open the example "RunLED" via the path: File --&gt; Examples --&gt; TickTockShield--&gt; RunLED.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Starter_Shield_EN/img/Open_RunLED_Code.jpg)

</dd><dd>3. This demo can sweep 4 LEDs with a settable speed. You can change the sweep speed by changing the parameter of the function "runLED(speed)". Find further illutration of the funtion in its comment.

</dd><dd>4. Click the upload button to upload the program to the Arduino.

</dd><dd>5. You can see four LED lights turn on and off from left to right at a given speed after the program is uploaded.

</dd></dl>

**Demo 2: Control LEDs By Keys**

This demo show you how to control LEDs with the most basic input - buttons.

<dl><dd>1. Open the example "ControlLED" in the same way as open the “RunLED” above.

</dd><dd>2. This demo can turn on or off four LEDs by keys. We set two flags to store the status of this test, TEST_START and TEST_END. Every time the “menu” key gets pressed, the status toggles between TEST_START and TEST_END. In the status of TEST_START, "increase" key can turn on one more LED from right to left every time it gets pressed. The "decrease" key has an inverse effect as the "increase" key.

</dd></dl>

**Demo 3: Change The Pitch Of Buzzer By Keys**
**This demo involves how to make a sound with buzzer, and because you have already known how to use buttons, in this demo, we use buttons to increase or decrease the pitch of buzzer.

<dl><dd>1. Open the example "changeThePitch".

</dd><dd>2. Every time the “increase” key gets pressed, the pitch of the buzzer will rise up. And when the “decrease” key gets pressed, the pitch will fall down.

</dd></dl>

**Demo 4: Display Temperature**

Get started with sensors. First we have here is the temperature sensor. Try to read its value and display it on the 7 segment display.

1. Open the example “MeasureTemprature”.
2. The 7-segment Display will display current temperature read from temperature sensor as shown below.
3. If you find in the picture below, the contrast is not strong enough, try a lower view angle. This principle also apply to following demos which contain usage of 7-segment display.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Starter_Shield_EN/img/Measure_Temperature.jpg)

**Demo 5: Make A Light Sensor Controlled LED**

Is it convenient if the brightness of display can auto adjust itself according to the ambient light? This demo shows you how to do this by using a light sensor.

1. Open the example “SensorControlBrightness” in the same way.

2. This example can change the brightness of BRIGHT_ADJUST Indicator according to the ambient light intensity. The darker the environment is, the lighter the LED turns. Picture on the right is the turnout.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Starter_Shield_EN/img/Connect_Tick_Shield.jpg)

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Starter_Shield_EN/img/Control_Light.jpg)

**Demo 6: Display Numerical Characters**

This demo shows you how to control the content of 7 segment display.

1. Open the example “CharacterFlow”.

2. This example can run numeric characters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9, A, b, C, d, E, F from right to left.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Starter_Shield_EN/img/Flow_Character.jpg)

**Demo 7: Real Time Clock**

This is a final demo that involves all hardware resources we mentioned above and performs all functions of a real life alarm clock, like time display, making a buzz to get you out of your bed and so on. What's more, because a light sensor and a temperature sensor are added, Tick Tock Shield does more than a normal alarm clock. It can sense the ambient light and auto-adjust the brightness of 7-segment display. Also it can show you the current temperature at a given time interval.

1. Open the example "RealTimeClock" and upload the example into Arduino.

2. The 7-segment Display will alternately display current time and temperature.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Starter_Shield_EN/img/Display_RTC_.jpg)

3. Method to adjust the time and set the alarm clock:

* 1) Because there is a RTC chip on board, so you don't need to reset the time every time you turn it on, of course, the condition is the coin battery for RTC chip is alive. But if this is your first time to start up the Tick Tock Shield, time setting is required.

* 2) Three buttons are used to adjust the time. They are "menu"(K3), "increase"(K2) and "decrease"(K1). Press "memu" to cycle between the next setting modes:

  * a) set the hour part of normal time display

  * b) set the minute part of normal time display

  * c) set the hour part of alarm clock

  * d) set the minute part of alarm clock

  * e) set the default brightness of 7 segment display

  * f) turn on or off the alarm function

  * g) quit time setting modes

* 3) If you want to quit before processing all 7 steps above. There are two interruption ways. One, press K3 no matter on which step for 3s. In this way,Tick Tock Shield will confirm all settings you have made and quit. Two, leave the Tick Tock Shield alone for 5s. In this way. No setting will be stored and you quit time setting mode also.

* 4) K2 is assigned to set the status of alarm clock. You can know the status of alarm clock via ALARM_ENABLE Indicator.
