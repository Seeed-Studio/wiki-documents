## Introduction
BitPlayer provides you inspiration and excitement to make creations such as a portable piano or a smart calculator. To be easier to carry and use, BitPlayer abandoned an all-button design that a typical game controller would use in favor of a 2-axes joystick. It includes another 6 programmable buttons labeled as L, R, A, B, C and D. Besides, the BitPlayer itself features a buzzer, a vibration motor and a Grove I2 C port to give kids lively and interactive experience of game. You can easily enjoy DIY projects anywhere by installing 2 AAA batteries into the BitPlayer. As tested already, BitPlayer can interact with other devices when Bluetooth positioning is within a distance range about 10 meter. If you want to implement a remote control car, we recommend that you also prepare a [BitCar](https://docproxy.tinkergen.com/web/#/2?page_id=357).

## Tutorials
Here are some related tutorials to help you get started with BitPlayer.


### 1. Finger Speed Game
#### 1.1 Implementation
In this project, we’ll light up the LEDs in sequence by manipulating the joystick. The light will run around the screen like a looping square.

#### 1.2 Write a Program
Note that in MakeCode we don’t have blocks to control the BitPlayer. Therefore we need to add a BitPlayer extension in MakeCode to make sure everything goes well. Let’s learn how to do it now!
【How to Add the BitPlayer Extension】
Let’s go to MakeCode: [https://makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

- Step 1 Click the gear icon (for settings) on the blue bar in MakeCode.
<!-- ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/2701823/1607656608337-28675e0d-cba2-4fcd-9e95-ea566db99f46.png#height=489&id=URYAb&originHeight=489&originWidth=1000&originalType=binary&ratio=1&size=0&status=done&style=none&width=1000) -->
![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/microbit/bitplayer/4.png)

- Step 2 Select “Extensions” from the drop-down list which takes you to the extensions page.
<!-- ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/2701823/1607656608593-1510b8dd-4f3f-49b2-8145-fd6e87b854db.png#height=699&id=AAz5P&originHeight=699&originWidth=914&originalType=binary&ratio=1&size=0&status=done&style=none&width=914) -->
![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/microbit/bitplayer/5.png)

- Step 3 Input the address of the BitPlayer extension into the search box: [https://github.com/TinkerGen/pxt-BitPlayer](https://github.com/TinkerGen/pxt-BitPlayer)
<!-- ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/2701823/1607656608308-08990569-fce3-4dc8-a07a-ad1c3f1182e1.png#height=937&id=b9Blo&originHeight=937&originWidth=1920&originalType=binary&ratio=1&size=0&status=done&style=none&width=1920) -->
![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/microbit/bitplayer/6.png)

> If it prompts that this extension does not exist, please close the browser and enter MakeCode again.

<!-- - Step 4 Click the extension package which takes you back to the workspace. You will see that the BitPlayer extension is then successfully added.![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/2701823/1607656608597-2ade6798-937e-47e0-8215-99e146f6d983.png#height=937&id=jyFxX&originHeight=937&originWidth=1920&originalType=binary&ratio=1&size=0&status=done&style=none&width=1920) -->
![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/microbit/bitplayer/7.png)

Let’s move on to the task.
Firstly, add an “on start” block. Let’s create 3 variables named as LED on, x coordinate and y coordinate.
Next, set the variable “LED on” as a sprite with an ordered pair (x coordinate, y coordinate). This ordered pair will initially start from (0, 0).<br />
Then, follow this program logic to code: if the joystick is pulled up, the y coordinate will change by -1; if the joystick is pulled down, the y coordinate will change by 1; if the joystick is pulled to left, the x coordinate will change by -1; if the joystick is pulled to right, the x coordinate will change by 1.

#### 1.3 Connect a Device
Straightly slide the micro:bit into BitPlayer and be careful not to reverse it. Then connect the micro:bit to your PC with a USB cable. Check if the LED indicator on the micro:bit lights up. If not, you need to unplug in the USB cable and connect it to the devices again.
#### 1.4 Download a Program
You have been introduced how to download a program in the [previous tutorials](https://docproxy.tinkergen.com/web/#/2?page_id=329), which can be simply concluded into steps as: rename a program, click the “Download” button and send it to the micro:bit.
#### 1.5 Run a Program
Turn on the switch on the BitPlayer and see if the micro:bit can work normally.
