Today, the grove series of sensors, actuators, and displays have grown into a large family. More and more grove modules will join the whole Grove ecosystem in the future. We see the Grove helps makers, engineers, teachers, students and even artists to build, to make, to create...We always feel it is our responsibility to make the Grove module compatible with more platforms. Now we bring you the [Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Base-Hat-for-Raspberry-Pi-p-3186.html) and Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi Zero, in another word, we bring the Raspberry Pi the whole Grove System.

The Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi provide Digital/Analog/I2C/PWM/UART port to meet all your needs. With the help of build-in MCU, a 12-bit 6 channel ADC is also available for Raspberry Pi.

Frankly speaking, it's about 60 Grove modules support the Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi now. However, we will continue to add new compatible modules, the more you use, the more grove added.

## Hardware Overview

### Pin Out

**Overview**

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/pin-out/overview.jpg)

**GPIO**

The same pin out as the raspberry pi.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/pin-out/1.jpg)

**Digital**

There are 2 digital Grove sockets in this board, normally the yellow wire(which connect to the top pin of the 4 pins Grove socket as) of Grove cable is the signal wire, so we name the digital Grove port **D5/D16**.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/pin-out/2.jpg)

**Analog**

As we know, there is no ADC in the Raspberry Pi, so it can not work with analog sensor directly. Now with the help of the build-in MCU STM32, the Grove base hat can work as an external 12-bit ADC, which means you can use analog sensor with your Raspberry Pi. Even more pleasing is that not one but four analog Grove sockets are available.

The analog sensor inputs the analog voltage into the 12-bit ADC. After the ADC convert the analog data to digital data, it input the digital data to the Raspberry Pi through the I2C interface.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/pin-out/4.jpg)

**PWM(pulse-width modulation)**

The Grove PWM Port connect to GPIO/BCM pin12(PWM0) and GPIO/BCM pin13(PWM1), which is the hardware PWM pin of Raspberry Pi, in addition, you can use all the GPIO pin as the soft PWM pin.

:::note
0- All the silkscreen layer pin number besides the Grove port is the BCM pin number. The difference between BCM pins and the physical pins please refer to [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=726435)

1- Compared with hardware PWM, the software PWM isn't so accurate and will have trouble at high frequencies.

2- The GPIO/BCM pin18 is also marked as PWM0, actually the GPIO/BCM 12 and the GPIO/BCM 18 share the same PWM channel, so they can't set to different rate.

3- The audio jack output also uses PWM 0 and PWM 1, so you can't have audio output on that socket and use the PWMs at the same time.
:::

**I2C**

The Grove I2C port connect to the I2C pin of the raspberry directly. Most of seeed's new grove modules have I2C interface,  you may find this port is extremely useful.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/pin-out/6.jpg)

**UART**

The Grove UART port connect to the GPIO14(UART0 TX) and GPIO15(UART0 RX). UART is commonly used on the Pi as a convenient way to control it over the GPIO, or access the kernel boot messages from the serial console (enabled by default).It can also be used as a way to interface an Arduino, bootloaded ATmega, ESP8266, etc with your Pi.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/pin-out/7.jpg)

**SWD**

We use SWD port to burn the firmware to this hat. In addition, you can see 3 GPIO pins in this section, i.e., **pin 9/pin 10/pin 11**. Those three pins do not used by any Grove port, you are free to use them without worrying about pin conflicts.

:::

Now you can use the Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi Zero with dozens Grove modules, tap the command **grove_** and press the `tab` key to check the supported Grove list.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~$ grove_
grove_3_axis_compass_bmm150        grove_i2c_color_sensor_v2          grove_mini_pir_motion_sensor       grove_rotary_angle_sensor          grove_temperature_sensor
grove_4_digit_display              grove_i2c_motor_driver             grove_moisture_sensor              grove_ryb_led_button               grove_thumb_joystick

grove_high_accuracy_temperature    grove_mech_keycap                  grove_relay                        grove_temperature_humidity_sensor  
pi@raspberrypi:~$ grove_

```

Then we will show you how to use them according to port type.

**PWM Port**

:::caution
If you are using **Raspberry Pi with Raspberrypi OS >= Bullseye**, you have to use this command line **only with Python3**.
:::

We will take the [Grove - buzzer](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Buzzer-p-768.html) for example to introduce the PWM port.

*Hardware connection diagram*

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/connect1.jpg)

Tap the following command `sudo grove_pwm_buzzer` in the command line interface.

```python
pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo grove_pwm_buzzer
Insert Grove-Buzzer to Grove-Base-Hat slot PWM[12 13 VCC GND]

3800
3400
3000
2900
2550
2270
2000
exiting application
```

The buzzer will ring a few times and then stop, the program will automatically exit.

**Digital Port**

:::caution
If you are using **Raspberry Pi with Raspberrypi OS >= Bullseye**, you have to use this command line **only with Python3**.
:::

We will take the [Grove - Ultrasonic Ranger](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic-Ranger-p-960.html) for example to introduce the Digital port.

*Hardware connection diagram*

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/connect2.jpg)

Tap the following command `grove_ultrasonic_ranger 5 6` in the command line interface.

```python
pi@raspberrypi:~$ python3 grove_ultrasonic_ranger 5 6
Detecting distance...
6.979909436456088 cm
7.966469074117726 cm
12.451204760321255 cm
15.184797089675378 cm
17.429220265355603 cm
18.73230112010035 cm
20.717752390894397 cm
19.83807004731277 cm
17.3059003106479 cm

^CTraceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/grove_ultrasonic_ranger", line 11, in <module>
    load_entry_point('grove.py==0.5', 'console_scripts', 'grove_ultrasonic_ranger')()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/grove/grove_ultrasonic_ranger.py", line 107, in main
    time.sleep(1)
KeyboardInterrupt

```

When you change the distance between the Grove - Ultrasonic Ranger and the target object, the measurment value will change accordingly.
Press `ctrl`+`c` to quit.

:::caution
For most grove module, you need to add the pin number parameter, like `grove_ultrasonic_ranger 5 6`, **5** and **6** are the GPIO/BCM pin. However, you may have noticed that in the first example `grove_pwm_buzzer`, we didn't add a parameter after the command. This is because the PWM port and I2C port do not require pin number parameters. You can find the pin number silkscreen just besides the Grove sokect.
:::

**Analog Port**

We will take the [Grove - Air quality sensor v1.3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Air-quality-sensor-v1-3-p-2439.html) for example to introduce the Analog port.

*Hardware connection diagram*

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/connect3.jpg)

Tap the following command `grove_air_quality_sensor_v1_3 0 1` in the command line interface.

```python
pi@raspberrypi:~$ grove_air_quality_sensor_v1_3 0 1
Detecting ...
62, Air Quality OK.
63, Air Quality OK.
61, Air Quality OK.

60, Air Quality OK.
59, Air Quality OK.
60, Air Quality OK.
60, Air Quality OK.
60, Air Quality OK.

57, Air Quality OK.
^CTraceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/grove_air_quality_sensor_v1_3", line 11, in <module>
    load_entry_point('grove.py==0.5', 'console_scripts', 'grove_air_quality_sensor_v1_3')()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/grove/grove_air_quality_sensor_v1_3.py", line 68, in main
    time.sleep(.1)
KeyboardInterrupt

```

You can use this sensor to detect the air quality. Press `ctrl`+`c` to quit.

:::note
You may have noticed that for the analog port, the silkscreen pin number is something like **A1, A0**, however in the command we use parameter **0** and **1**, just the same as digital port. So please make sure you plug the module into the correct port, otherwise there may be pin conflicts.
:::

**I2C**

We will take the [Grove - OLED Display 128x64](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-OLED-Display-0-9-p-781.html) for example to introduce the I2C port.

*Hardware connection diagram*

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_Base_Hat_for_Raspberry_Pi_Zero/img/connect4.jpg)

Tap the following command `grove_oled_display_128x64` in the command line interface.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~$ grove_oled_display_128x64
pi@raspberrypi:~$ 
```

It seems nothing happened, however you can find the most famous sentence in the cyber world if you check your oled.üòÑ

:::note
If you use the I2C tool to scan the I2C address of the grove module, you may find two or more address. 0x04 is the adrress of the *Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi*.

:::noteChange Note

Because ST32 series chips are out of stock globally, prices have increased several times and there is no clear delivery date. We have no choice but to switch to the MM32 chip. The specific replacement models are as follows: STM32F030F4P6TR is replaced by MM32F031F6P6. After the chip is replaced, the product functions, features, usage methods and codes remain unchanged. It should be noted that the firmware version has changed, and the factory firmware has been adjusted according to different chips. If you need to re-burn the firmware, please download the firmware corresponding to the chip.
