## <span id="jump2"> How to Convert Raspberry Pi 5 to NAS? </span>

Converting the Raspberry Pi 5 into a NAS is not complicated. Just follow these steps:

### Step 1: Prepare the Hardware
- [A Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Raspberry-Pi-5-8GB-p-5810.html)
- A microSD card (32GB or larger recommended)
- A stable power adapter
- External hard drive or SSD
- Network connection (wired or wireless)

### Step 2: Install the Operating System

1. Use a tool like [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to write the OS image to the microSD card.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/imager.png" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

2. Select "Raspberry Pi 5" -> "Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)" -> SD card (make sure to select the correct device to avoid data loss if other USB devices are connected), then click "Next." Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/burn1.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

3. Then, edit the settings. Here‚Äôs an example of the settings provided:
- Enter your chosen hostname nas (recommended in this tutorial).
- Enter a username and password, which you will need later for authentication.
- Check the box next to "Configure WiFi" so your Pi can automatically connect to Wi-Fi.
- Enter your network SSID (name) and password.
- Check the box next to "Enable SSH," so we can connect to the Pi without using a mouse and keyboard.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/burn2.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

4. After clicking "Save," start burning the image. The process may take some time. When it appears as shown in the image below, it indicates that the burning is complete.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/Burn completed.png" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

### Step 3: Remote Connection to the Pi

After inserting the SD card, power up the Raspberry Pi (if possible, connect it to the network via an Ethernet cable, but in this tutorial, we will use WiFi chosen during imaging).

Open a terminal session on your computer and access the Raspberry Pi via SSH by running the following command, replacing **username** and **hostname** with the ones set during imaging:

```bash
$ ssh <username>@<hostname>.local
```

For example:

```bash
$ ssh seeed@nas.local
```

You will need to enter the password you created during imaging. Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/Remote Connection.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

Now that we have completed the SSH connection, it‚Äôs time to turn it into a NAS.

### Step 4: Install and Configure NAS

#### 1.Locate the Drive

First, connect the storage device to the Raspberry Pi, then check the connected storage devices with the following command:

```bash
$ lsblk
```

You will see output similar to this:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/locate the drive.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

:::tip
In this output, mmcblk0 is your microSD card, and the first connected USB storage device appears as sda (Storage Device A). Additional devices will be sdb, sdc, etc.
:::

#### 2.Partition the Drive

Next, partition the drive so that Raspberry Pi OS can recognize it as a single storage device:

```bash
$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

Here are some relevant commands:
- Create a new partition: n
- List current partitions: p
- Delete a partition: d
- Quit without saving changes: q

In this project, we will proceed to create a fresh partition by entering ‚Äò**n**‚Äô followed by pressing the **Enter** key, and we will designate it as a primary partition by typing ‚Äò**p**‚Äô and then pressing **Enter**. For the remaining options, we will opt for the default settings by simply pressing **Enter**. Should an existing partition be present, we will remove it by typing ‚Äò**d**‚Äô.Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/partition the drive1.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

:::tip
If the message "**All space for primary partitions is in use**" appears, it means there are already four primary partitions or three primary partitions and an extended partition on the disk, and you will need to delete a partition (**d**).
:::

:::note
If there are mounted partitions on the disk (like my sda1), follow these steps to unmount them:
1. Exit fdisk: Type q and press Enter to exit fdisk and avoid accidental modifications.
2. Unmount file systems: If there are mounted partitions on the disk, unmount them first. You can view the mounted partitions with the following command:

```bash
$ mount | grep /dev/sda
```

3. Then unmount them using the umount command, for example:

```bash
$ sudo umount /dev/sda1
```

4. Run:

```bash
$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda 
```

Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/partition the drive2.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

Then, return to the partitioning step above.
:::

#### 3.Format the Drive

Now that the drive has been partitioned, it's essential to format it to ensure that the Raspberry Pi OS can access and manipulate data on it. To format your drive with the ext4 file system, use the following command:

```bash
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
```

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/format the drive.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

#### 4.Mount the Drive

Next, mount the drive to make it available in the Raspberry Pi's file system:
```bash
$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
```

And ensure that the drive is mounted every time the system starts:
```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add the following line to the end of the file:
```
/dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1/ ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1
```

Press **Ctrl**+**X**, then **Y**, and finally **Enter** to save the edited file in nano. Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/mount the drive.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

#### 5.Create a Shared Folder

Run the following command to create a shared folder on your drive:
```bash
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/sda1/shared
```

Grant read, write, and execute permissions to all users on the Raspberry Pi with the following command:
```bash
$ sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/sda1/shared
```

Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/create a shared folder.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>


### Step 5: Share the Drive Over the Network

Run the following command to install [Samba](https://www.samba.org/), a tool for sharing directories over a network:
```bash
$ sudo apt install samba samba-common-bin
```

Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/Share the Drive Over the Network1.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>


Then, configure Samba to share the directory over the network. We can instruct Samba through the Samba configuration file. Open the configuration file in an editor: smb.conf
```bash
$ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add the following lines at the end of the file:
```
[shared]
path=/mnt/sda1/shared
writeable=Yes
create mask=0777
directory mask=0777
public=no
```

Press **Ctrl**+**X**, then **Y**, and finally **Enter** to save the edited file in nano. Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/Share the Drive Over the Network2.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

Restart Samba to apply the configuration changes:
```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/Share the Drive Over the Network3.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>


### Step 6: Grant access to the drive

Finally, you need to grant access to the Samba share so that only authenticated users can access the files over the network. Run the following command to create a user to manage the Samba share, naming the username as pinas in this example:

```bash
$ sudo adduser <username>
```

Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/Grant access to the drive1.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>


Then, add a password for that user using the following command:
```bash
$ sudo smbpasswd -a <username>
```

Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/Grant access to the drive2.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>


### Step 7: Access and Use the NAS

#### From Windows

1. Open File Explorer and select "Map network drive" from the Computer menu.
2. Choose a drive letter and enter the folder path, using a domain name format to easily access the device even if the IP address changes (in this tutorial, the path is \\nas\pinas).
3. Enter the login username and password. Here is an example:

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_NAS/Access and Use the NAS.gif" alt="pir" width={800} height="auto" /></div>

4. Once logged in, you can access the files on the server.

### Next Step

If you want to make your hard drive and Raspberry Pi look more organized and aesthetically pleasing, you can use a 3D printer to create brackets and enclosures to secure the Raspberry Pi and the external hard drive, and then assemble them together.
