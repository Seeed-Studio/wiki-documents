**Bluetooth Bee** is an easy to use <font size={4} face="黑体">Bluetooth Serial Port Profile(SPP)</font> module compatible with existing **Xbee** sockets, designed for transparent wireless serial connection setup.
Serial port Bluetooth module is fully qualified Bluetooth V2.0+EDR(Enhanced Data Rate) 3Mbps Modulation with complete 2.4GHz radio transceiver and baseband. It uses **CSR Bluecore 04**-External single chip Bluetooth system with CMOS technology and with AFH(Adaptive Frequency Hopping Feature). It has the smallest footprint of **12.7mm x 27mm**

Model:[WLS125E1P](https://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/bluetooth-bee-p-598.html?cPath=139_142)

## Features ##

### Hardware Features ###

- Typical -80dBm sensitivity.

- Up to +4dBm RF transmit power.

- Fully Qualified Bluetooth V2.0+EDR 3Mbps Modulation.

- Low Power 1.8V Operation, 1.8 to 3.6V I/O.

- PIO control.

- UART interface with programmable baud rate.

- Integrated PCB antenna.

- xBee compatible headers.

### Software Features ###

- Default Baud rate: <font size={4} font face="黑体">38400</font>, Data bits:8, Stop bit:1,Parity:No parity, Data control: has.

- Supported baud rate: 9600,19200,38400,57600,115200,230400,460800.

- Use CTS and RTS to control the data stream.

- When a rising pulse is detected in PIO0, device will be disconnected.

- Status instruction port PIO1: low-disconnected, high-connected;

- PIO10 is connected to <font color="red" font>red</font>led, PIO11 is connected to green led. When master and slave are paired, red and green led blinks 1time / 2s in interval, while disconnected only green led blinks 2 times/ s.

- Auto-connect the last device on power as default.

- Permit matched device connect by default.

- Default PINCODE:”0000”.

- Auto-reconnect in 30 min when disconnected as a result of beyond the range of connection.

## Application Ideas ##

- As a Wireless Serial Port for Arduino / [Seeeduino](https://seeeddoc.github.io/Seeeduino_V2.2/)  and other MCUs

- As a Bluetooth Serial Port for PC when connected with UartSBee

## Cautions ##

- While using with Seeeduino / Arduino, set the operation voltage to 3.3V. Else use a proper logic level converter.

- While using with UartSBee, set the operation voltage to 3.3V

- Command to change baud rate is persistent even after reset. Hence remember the baud rate for next use.

- When using SoftwareSerial, do not set the baud rate above 38400

- 3 - Connecting

- 4 - Connected

(**Note**: This is not a command, but the information returned from the module after every command)

### Programming ###

#### Flow Control Based Implementation ####

The following sketch configures **Bluetooth Bee** for [Transportunternehmen](http://aps-solver.de/leistungen/) as Slave Device and waits for connection request from PC or other master device.
Bluetooth Bee is  connected to Seeeduino via XBee Shield as shown above. Bluetooth Bee is connected to digital Pins 11 and 12 of Arduino / Seeduino. We use NewSoftSerial library for supporting serial communication on these pins. The hardware serial port of Arduino is available for uploading sketch or debugging. This sketch uses a flow control mechanism using CheckOK(). It avoids using arbitrary delay between each command. If CheckOK() is not required, use a delay of at least 3 seconds between commands.

#### Delay Based Implementation ####

The following sketch is a modification of above program using delay() instead of CheckOK(). In this case the hardware serial port is used for debugging purpose. Open serial monitor with setting 9600 baud. The complete communication between MCU and Bluetooth Bee will be visible in serial monitor.

#### Connecting Bluetooth Bee to PC (via Bluetooth Dongle) under GNU/Linux ####

This procedure demonstrates how **Bluetooth Bee** can be connected to PC under GNU/Linux OS. An USB Bluetooth Dongle is used at PC side to communicate with **Bluetooth Bee**. The flow control implementation sketch is uploaded to Seeeduino.

- Install gnome-bluetooth

`
sudo apt-get install gnome-bluetooth
`

- Open bluetooth-properties application from shell

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_linux_config0.png)

- Click Set up new device

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_linux_config1.png)

and click Forward

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_linux_config2.png)

- Open PIN options...

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_linux_config2.1.png)

- Set Fixed PIN 0000. 0000 is the default pin used in the above sketch.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_linux_config3.png)

- Device Setup Window opens

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_linux_config4.png)

- and Setup Completed dialog opens. Click Close.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_linux_config5.png)

- The address of the **Bluetooth Bee**00:13:EF:00:00:24 is displayed in shell.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_linux_config6.png)

- Bind the **Bluetooth Bee** to rfcomm port. Here the address of **Bluetooth Bee** is bound to a serial port device /dev/rfcomm0

```
user@user-desktop:~$ sudo rfcomm bind 0 00:13:EF:00:00:24 1
user@user-desktop:~$ ls /dev/rfcomm*
/dev/rfcomm0
```

- This /dev/rfcomm0 serial port can be accessed by any serial port terminal like cutecom.

- Open /dev/rfcomm0 with baud rate:38400, Databits: 8, Stopbits: 1 and No Flow Control
- Send character 'a'

- Seeeduino + Bluetooth Bee will reply with **"You are connected to Bluetooth Bee"**

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_linux_config8.png)

#### Connecting Bluetooth Bee to PC (via Bluetooth Dongle) under Windows ####

- Install the Microsoft Bluetooth default drivers. Open Control Panel -> Bluetooth Devices

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_windows0.jpg)

- Click Add button.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_windows1.jpg)

- Check My devices is set up  and ready to be found and click Next button

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_windows2.jpg)

- Select the "SeeedBlueToothBee" device and click Next.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_windows3.jpg)

- Select Use the passkey found in the documentation and enter 0000

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_windows4.jpg)

- Passkeys are exchanged and an outgoing serial port COM5 is assigned for our communication.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_windows5.jpg)

- A task-bar balloon shows that a new Bluetooth Serial Port link is added.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_windows6.jpg)

- COM5 is assigned for communication. This port should be used to communicate PC with Bluetooth Bee.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/Bluetooth_windows7.jpg)

- This COM5  serial port can be accessed by any Serial Port terminal.

- Open COM5  with baud rate:38400, Databits: 8, Stopbits: 1 and No Flow Control
- Send character 'a'

- Seeeduino + Bluetooth Bee will reply with "You are connected to Bluetooth Bee"

#### Connecting Bluetooth Bee to PC using UartsBee in Master Mode ####

This demo uses hardware arrangement described in [Hardware Installation - UartSBee. Connect UartSbee to PC using a mini USB cable.

- Open a serial terminal and connect to UartSBee serial port device like COM1 in Windows or /dev/ttyUSB0 in GNU/Linux with baud rate:38400, Databits: 8, Stopbits: 1 and No Flow Control

- Send \r\n+STWMOD=1\r\n command. This configures the **Bluetooth Bee** in master mode.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/BTBee_Master1.png)

- Send \r\n+INQ=1\r\n command. **Bluetooth Bee** searches available Bluetooth devices in neighborhood and list the address of the devices. In this case with +RTINQ=0,19,86,0,19,1E;desktop, where desktop is a PC with Bluetooth interface. While inquiring the red and green led blinks alternatively.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/BTBee_Master2.png)

- Send \r\n+CONN=0,19,86,0,19,1E\r\n where 0,19,86,0,19,1E is the address of desktop.

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Bluetooth-Bee/img/BTBee_Master3.png)

- Enter the pin 0000 at PC side and complete the connection.
