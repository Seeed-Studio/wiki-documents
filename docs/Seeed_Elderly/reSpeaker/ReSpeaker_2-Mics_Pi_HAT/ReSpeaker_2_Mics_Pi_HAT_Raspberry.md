**2. Setup the driver on Raspberry Pi**

Make sure that you are running [the latest Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) on your Pi. *(updated at 2021.05.01)*

- Step 1. Get the Seeed voice card source code, install and reboot.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
git clone https://github.com/seeed-studio-projects/seeed-voicecard.git
cd seeed-voicecard
sudo ./install.sh
sudo reboot now
```

- Step 2. Check that the sound card name matches the source code seeed-voicecard by command ```aplay -l``` and ```arecord -l```.

```shell
pi@raspberrypi:~/Desktop/mic_hat $ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****

  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

- Step 3. Test, you will hear what you say to the microphones(don't forget to plug in an earphone or a speaker):

```bash
arecord -D "plughw:3,0" -f S16_LE -r 16000 -d 5 -t wav test.wav
aplay -D "plughw:3,0" test.wav
```

**Note:**  "plughw:3,0" is the recording(or playback device number) , depending on your system this number may differ (for example on Raspberry Pi 0 it will be 0, since it doesn't have audio jack) We can find it via "arecord -l" and "aplay -l".

**3. Configure sound settings and adjust the volume with alsamixer**

**alsamixer** is a graphical mixer program for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) that is used to configure sound settings and adjust the volume.

```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ alsamixer
```

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/MIC_HATv1.0_for_raspberrypi/img/alsamixer.png)

The Left and right arrow keys are used to select the channel or device and the Up and Down Arrows control the volume for the currently selected device. Quit the program with ALT+Q, or by hitting the Esc key. [More information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsamixer)

:::caution
    Please use the F6 to select seeed-2mic-voicecard device first.
:::

## Usage overview

To run the following examples, clone <https://github.com/respeaker/mic_hat.git> repository to your Raspberry Pi

```bash
git clone https://github.com/respeaker/mic_hat.git
cd mic_hat
```

All the Python scripts, mentioned in the examples below can be found inside this repository. To install the necessary dependencies, from mic_hat repository folder, run

```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev libatlas-base-dev
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**APA102 LEDs**

Each on-board APA102 LED has an additional driver chip. The driver chip takes care of receiving the desired color via its input lines, and then holding this color until a new command is received.

```bash
python3 interfaces/pixels.py
```

  <source src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/MIC_HATv1.0_for_raspberrypi/img/led.webmhd.webm" />
</video>

**User Button**

There is an on-board User Button, which is connected to GPIO17. Now we will try to detect it with python and RPi.GPIO.

Execute the following code from mic_hat folder repository, which you cloned at Step 4.

```bash
python3 interfaces/button.py
```

It should display "on" when you press the button:

```bash
python3 button.py
```

Output like

```txt
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ python3 button.py
off
off
on
on
off
```

### Record sound with Python

We use [PyAudio python library](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) to record sound with Python.

First, run the following script to get the device index number of 2 Mic pi hat:

```bash
python3 recording_examples/get_device_index.py
```

You will see the device ID as below.

```bash
Input Device id  2  -  seeed-2mic-voicecard: - (hw:1,0)
```

To record the sound, open ```recording_examples/record.py``` file with nano or other text editor and change  `RESPEAKER_INDEX = 2` to index number of ReSpeaker on your system. Then run python script record.py to make a recording:

```bash
python3 recording_examples/record.py
```

If you want to extract channel 0 data from 2 channels, have a look at the content of ```record_one_channel.py```. For other channel X, please change [0::2] to [X::2].

```bash
python3 recording_examples/record_one_channel.py
```

To play the recorded samples you can either use aplay system utility, for example

```bash
aplay -f cd -Dhw:1 output.wav #for Stereo sound
aplay -D plughw:1,0 output_one_channel.wav #for Mono sound from one channel
```

Alternatively you can use recording_examples/play.py script to play the .wav files with PyAudio.

```bash
python3 recording_examples/play.py path-to-wav-file
```

Make sure to specify the right output device index in play.py - otherwise PyAudio will freeze!
