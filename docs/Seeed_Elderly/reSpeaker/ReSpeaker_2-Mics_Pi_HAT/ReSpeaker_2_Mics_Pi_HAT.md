ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT is a dual-microphone expansion board for Raspberry Pi designed for AI and voice applications. This means that you can build a more powerful and flexible voice product that integrates Amazon Alexa Voice Service, Google Assistant, and so on.

The board is developed based on WM8960, a low power stereo codec. There are 2 microphones on both sides of the board for collecting sounds and it also provides 3 APA102 RGB LEDs, 1 User Button and 2 on-board Grove interfaces for expanding your applications. What is more, 3.5mm Audio Jack or JST 2.0 Speaker Out are both available for audio output.

## Enabling Voice Recognition at the Edge with Picovoice

<div align="center"><img width = "{700}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/ReSpeaker_4_Mic_Array_for_Raspberry_Pi/banner.gif"/></div>

[**Picovoice**](https://picovoice.ai/) **enables enterprises to innovate and differentiate rapidly with private voice AI**. Build a unified AI strategy around your brand and products with our speech recognition and [**Natural-language understanding (NLU) technologies**](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/natural-language-understanding-NLU).

**Seeed has partnered with Picovoice to bring Speech Recognition solution at the edge using [ReSpeaker 2-Mic Pi HAT](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-2-Mics-Pi-HAT-p-2874.html) for developers.**

Picovoice is an end-to-end platform for building voice products on your terms. It enables creating voice experiences similar to Alexa and Google. But it entirely runs 100% on-device. There are advantages of Picovoice:

* **Private**: Everything is processed offline. Intrinsically HIPAA and GDPR compliant.
* **Reliable**: Runs without needing constant connectivity.
* **Zero Latency**: Edge-first architecture eliminates unpredictable network delay.
* **Accurate**: Resilient to noise and reverberation. It outperforms cloud-based alternatives by wide margins.
* **Cross-Platform**: Design once, deploy anywhere. Build using familiar languages and frameworks.

## Open-source Keyword detection with Mycroft Precise

In addition to Picovoice, we provide limited support for Mycroft Precise - an open-source real-time keyword detection package. Mycroft Precise is fully open source and can be trained to recognize anything from a name to a cough. Precise is designed to run on Linux. It is known to work on a variety of Linux distributions including Debian, Ubuntu and Raspbian. According to official README file, "it probably operates on other *nx distributions."

Mycroft Precise is Apache-2.0 License project, which means you can modify and distribute it, including for commercial purposes - the only requirement being that you preserve the original license.

**You can find examples for both Picovoice products and Mycroft Precise in Getting Started documentation for corresponding platform.**
