## Getting started

### Connecting to the embedded operating system

:::note
    There are two ways described in the manual. In this case, we only show an advanced method (using USB to Serial adapter) which might seem a little harder. But, you will benefit a lot from it in the long run.
:::
#### Materials required

* LinkIt Smart 7688 x 1
* USB cable (type A to micro type-B) x 1
* USB to Serial adapter x 1
* Jumper wires x 3

### On Windows

**1.** Install [PuTTy](http://www.putty.org/). PuTTY provides a system console environment using SSH (Secure Socket Shell) to access development board's operating system.

**2.** Install [Bonjour](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) Print Service (For Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10).

**3.** Install driver. If you are using a USB cable based on FTDI chip please download and install its driver from [here](https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm). If you are having problems with the latest driver, try installing an [older version](https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/InstallGuides.htm).

**4.** Next, you need to connect the Serial-to-USB cable to LinkIt Smart 7688's UART pins as shown in the following table:


| Pin on USB adapter |	Corresponding Pin to be connected on LinkIt Smart 7688 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Pin RX	| Pin 8 |
| Pin TX	| Pin 9 |
| Pin GND |	Pin GND |

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkIt_Smart_7688_Duo/img/7688_duo_demo_view_1200_s.jpg)

**5.** After connecting the Serial to USB cable, open the device manager and notice the COM port number as shown in Figure 22. This number may vary on different computers.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkIt_Smart_7688_Duo/img/COM_port.jpg)

**6.** Launch the PuTTY terminal and enter the COM port number of the USB device found in the device manager, click on the Serial radio button, type 57600 in Speed box and click Open, as shown in Figure 23.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkIt_Smart_7688_Duo/img/Putty_configuration.jpg)

**7.** To exit the system console, click the **close icon** on top right of the PuTTY windows.

### On Mac

**1.** Install the driver if needed. Check the cable manufacturer's website for driver requirements on Mac and installation instructions.

**2.** Plug-in the cable to PC/Laptop and connect the cable to LinkIt Smart 7688.

**3.** Open a Terminal session.

**4.** Type **ls /dev/cu** in the Terminal. You should see a list of devices. Look for something like cu.usbserial-XXXXXXXX where XXXXXXXX is usually a random identifier. This is the serial device used to access the system console.

**For example:**

```
$ls /dev/cu*

/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port

/dev/cu.Bluetooth-Modem

/dev/cu.pablop-WirelessiAP

/dev/cu.usbserial-A6YMCQBR

```

**5.** Use the screen utility to connect to the serial port and set the baudrate to 57600. This is because the baudrate of the system console is 57600 by default. For example:
```
$screen /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXXXXXX 57600
```
**6.** Now you should be connected to the system console. Press ENTER in the Terminal to bring up the prompt. You will notice that the prompt has become different from your OS X Terminal application, it is the LinkIt Smart 7688 prompt and it looks like the following:
```
  root@myLinkIt:/#
```
**7.** You are ready to make changes to the LinkIt Smart 7688 system through this console.

### On Linux

**1.** Install the driver if needed. Check the cable manufacturer's website for driver requirements on Linux and installation instructions.

**2.** Plug-in the cable and connect the cable to LinkIt Smart 7688 Duo.

**3.** Open a Terminal session.

**4.** Type **ls /dev/ttyUSB*** in the Terminal. You should see a list of devices. Look for something like cu.usbserial-XXXXXXXX where XXXXXXXX is usually a random identifier. This is the serial device used to access the system console. For example:
```
$ls /dev/ttyUSB*
/dev/ttyUSB0
```
**5.** Use the **screen** utility to connect to the serial port and set the baudrate to **57600**. This is because the baudrate of the system console is 57600 by default. For example:
```
$sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 57600
```
**6.** Now you should be connected to the system console. Press ENTER in the Terminal to bring up the prompt. You will notice that the prompt has become a different regular application, it is the LinkIt Smart 7688 prompt and it looks like the following:
```
  root@myLinkIt:/#
```
**7.** You are ready to make changes to the LinkIt Smart 7688 system through this console.

**5.** The installation is completed.

### Installing LinkIt Smart 7688 Duo COM Port Driver

After installing the board package, connect LinkIt Smart 7688 Duo to your computer and you should see a USB serial COM port in the device manager with the following port ID:

* Boot loader COM port: VID=0x0E8D, PID=0xAB00
* Arduino Sketch COM port: VID=0x0E8D, PID=0xAB01

Next, you will need to install drivers depending on your operating system. The steps are:

:::note
    For Windows 10, there is no need to install a driver. However, extra steps are needed to ensure Windows 10 recognizes the board. Connect LinkIt Smart 7688 Duo to your Windows 10 machine, then quickly press the MCU reset button twice within 700 milliseconds. The system should now recognize LinkIt Smart 7688 Duo as a USB Serial Device (COM5). The number 5 may be different on different machines. You only need to do this the first time the board is connected to your Windows machine.
:::
:::note
    For Windows 8, the system may block the driver installation. Follow this link to know how to disable driver signature enforcement on Windows 8. After the signature enforcement is disabled, follow the steps in Windows 7 below to install the driver.
:::
:::note
    For Windows 7, find the Serial COM port INF driver in the following path. You can also install it from here.
{ARDUINO_IDE_PREFERENCE_LOCATION}Arduino15/packages/LinkIt/hardware/avr/0.1.5/driver/linkit_smart_7688.inf
:::
You will find the Arduino preference location at **File -> Preferences**, see the **preference.txt path**.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkIt_Smart_7688_Duo/img/Preference_location.jpg)

Right click on the linkit_smart_7688.inf and select install, a security windows appears and **click Install this driver software anyway**. This completes the driver installation.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkIt_Smart_7688_Duo/img/Driver_inst_alert.jpg)

* For Ubuntu Linux, it should work without installing a driver. LinkIt Smart 7688 should be in /dev folder and mounted as ttyUSB0. The number 0 may be different on each Ubuntu machine.
* For OS X, it is also not required to install a driver, LinkIt Smart 7688 Duo is mounted as a serial device under/dev/tty.usbmodem1413. The number 1413 may be different on each OS X machine.


##Demo: A Hello world example

:::note
    To avoid running out of memory during native application developments, you should setup the native application development environment in a more powerful host environment that enables you to cross-compile the executable format of the LinkIt Smart 7688 target instead. The following table shows an overview of the LinkIt Smart 7688 programming languages and the related development environments on host computer.
:::
###Python

**1.** Use FileZilla and refer to this [tutorial](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/FileZilla_Client_Tutorial_%28en%29), the server IP(replace **host name**) address is the inet addr found in previous [Switch to Station mode](https://seeeddoc.github.io/LinkIt_Smart_7688_Duo#Switch_to_Station_mode) section, the username is root and password is password you set in that section.

**2.** Open a text editor, copy and paste the below example code and save it as **helloworld.py**.
```
print "Hello World!"
```
**3.** Copy the file **helloworld.py** into system on target development environment (LinkIt Smart 7688) with FileZilla, place it under the folder **root**.

**4.** Launch PuTTy and connect to system with USB to Serial adapter.

**5.** Set working directory to **/root** and enter **python helloworld.py** to execute.

**6.** Now you can see **Hello World**! printed in console.

###Arduino

####On host computer(Arduino side)

The MCU side is written as an Arduino sketch. In this example, the sketch simply listens to the command sent from the MPU (Linux) side and switches the on-board LED accordingly.

**1.** First, connect the LinkIt Smart 7688 Duo to your PC, then open Arduino IDE and paste the following sketch code into the IDE:

```
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200); // open serial connection to USB Serial port (connected to your computer)
    Serial1.begin(57600); // open internal serial connection to MT7688
    // in MT7688, this maps to device
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
    int c = Serial1.read(); // read from MT7688
    if (c != -1) {
        switch(c) {
        case '0': // turn off D13 when receiving "0"
            digitalWrite(13, 0);
            break;
        case '1': // turn off D13 when receiving "1"
            digitalWrite(13, 1);
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

**2.** Then choose the correct COM port from the IDE (check your device manager) by clicking **Tools -> Port**.

**3.** Upload the sketch to the board. Note the board is not blinking yet - you will need to write a program in the Linux side to make it blink, which is the next step.

![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/LinkIt_Smart_7688_Duo/img/Blink_in_arduino.jpg)


####On development board(Linux side)

**1.** Use a text editor of your choice and create a new file(a Python file), then copy the following code and save it.


```
import serial
import time
s = None
def setup():
    global s
# open serial COM port to /dev/ttyS0, which maps to UART0(D0/D1)
# the baudrate is set to 57600 and should be the same as the one
# specified in the Arduino sketch uploaded to ATmega32U4.
s = serial.Serial("/dev/ttyS0", 57600)
def loop():
# send "1" to the Arduino sketch on ATmega32U4.
# the sketch will turn on the LED attached to D13 on the board
s.write("1")
time.sleep(1)
# send "0" to the sketch to turn off the LED
s.write("0")
time.sleep(1)
if __name__ == '__main__':
setup()
while True:
loop()
```

**2.** Execute this Python program in the system console - this program basically writes string of 1 and 0 to the /dev/ttyS0 port which maps to Serial1 interface in Arduino. The Arduino sketch that was uploaded in the previous section will receive the string and then blink the on-board LED accordingly.

You can now extend the Arduino sketch to drive other devices such as PWM, I2C devices and synchronize the states by extending the command messages between Arduino and the Linux side. If more peripheral types need to be included, you can use some external libraries to implement the communication protocol. One such protocol - Firmata is described in the following section.
