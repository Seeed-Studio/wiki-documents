The Xadow NFC v2 features the most popular NFC chipset on the market - a highly integrated transceiver module PN532\. This chipset is very powerful and can be found in most of the smart phones and NFC devices. It can be used to read and write to tags and cards, acting like NFC tags. Currently, we have developed Arduino libraries to support reading and writing to MIFARE Class and MIFARE Ultralight Card. The board also adopts the new 11 PIN Xadow connector to improve the flexibility of module connections.

## About Near Field Communication (NFC)

Near Field Communication (NFC) is the set of protocols for the communication of electronic devices that are proximity to each other (typically 10 cm or less). Full NFC devices usually have three working modes:

*   Card Emulation: typically used in entrance card, or in smart phones to let them acts like smart cards to perform payment process or ticketing
*   Reader/Writer Mode: used to read the information stored in the NFC tags
*   Peer-to-peer Mode: used for data exchanging between devices

We’ve been looking for a better place where our backers (RePhone Users) can sit together, warmly and comfortably, have conversations about RePhone, discuss technical problems, share ideas/projects, and give feedback on the modules’ development in the future. And then here we go, the RePhone Community.

Now join us in the [RePhone Community](https://forum.seeedstudio.com/viewforum.php?f=71&sid=b70f8138c89becf7701260bb41faf9f4)! Together we seek answers, make interesting stuff, care about each other, and share our experiences.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Some frequently asked questions in RePhone Community are collected and answered to the topic **["Frequently Asked Questions of RePhone (FAQ)"](http://forum.seeedstudio.com/viewtopic.php?f=71&t=6664&p=23753#p23753)** , the topic will be kept updating whenever a new FAQ comes out.
