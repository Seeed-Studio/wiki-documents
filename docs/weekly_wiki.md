## Greetings

This is Seraphina in Seeed Studio and welcome to the Seeed Studio weekly wiki! Each Monday, I will introduce you our latest wiki, including the ones related to our new products, the interesting projects published by Seeed Studio, and the tutorials, introductions, etc... You name it.

✨ For each week, when a collaborator contributes a project or fixes something important, we put the stars at the end of title of "Weekly Wiki" for more people be able to see their efforts👍.

Today is December 18th and a brand new week has begun! Check out what Seeed Studio did last week!

## Latest Wiki Launched

### [Grove Vision AI Module V2](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/grove_vision_ai_v2/)

The Grove - Vision AI V2 is a thumb-sized AI vision sensor equipped with the WiseEye2 HX653 processor, which adopts the Arm Cortex-M55 dual-core architecture. It features a standard CSI interface and is compatible with Raspberry Pi cameras. It has an onboard digital microphone and an SD card slot. It is highly suitable for various embedded AI vision projects. With the SenseCraft AI algorithm platform, trained ML models can be deployed to the sensor without the need for coding. It is compatible with the XIAO series and Arduino ecosystems, making it an ideal choice for various object detection applications.

### [Object Tracking with reTerminal and Pi camera with OpenCV](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/mmwave_for_xiao_to_ha_bt)

Object tracking is the process of consistently locating a specific object across consecutive frames in a video. In the realm of single object trackers, the initial frame serves as a reference, with the target object marked by a bounding rectangle. Subsequent frames then employ tracking algorithms to follow and trace the object's movement. Typically, these trackers are utilized alongside object detectors in real-world applications, combining the strengths of both technologies for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
