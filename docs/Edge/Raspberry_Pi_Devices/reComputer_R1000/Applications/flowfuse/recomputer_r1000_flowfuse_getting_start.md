## Introduction

[FlowFuse](https://flowfuse.com/) enhances Node-RED by adding features for collaborative development, managing remote deployments, supporting DevOps delivery pipelines, and hosting Node-RED applications. It serves as a DevOps platform specifically designed for the development and delivery of Node-RED applications, making it easier for teams to work together and deploy their projects efficiently.


## Getting Start

Before you start this project, you may need to prepare your hardware and software in advance as described here.

## Software Preparation

### Installing Node.js for FlowFuse on a reComputer

To prepare your reComputer for FlowFuse, you need to install Node.js. Follow these steps to install Node.js version 20:

1. **Preparing for the Node.js Repository**

First, update your package list and install the necessary certificates and tools:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
```
2. **Setting Up the NodeSource Repository**

Next, set up the NodeSource repository on your reComputer:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nodesource.gpg
```

3. **Adding the Node.js Repository**

According to FlowFuse documentation, it is recommended to install Node.js version 20. Set the `NODE_MAJOR` variable to 20:

```sh
NODE_MAJOR=20
```

Add the Node.js repository to your reComputer‚Äôs sources list:

```sh
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_$NODE_MAJOR.x nodistro main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
```
Update your package list again to include the Node.js repository:

```sh
sudo apt update
```
4. **Installing Node.js**

Finally, install Node.js:

```sh
sudo apt install nodejs
```
Now you have Node.js version 20 installed on your device.

## Creating a Flow in FlowFuse

Let's create a flow in Node-RED to generate a random number and display it on a dashboard. If you're new to Node-RED, you can visit our [Node-RED Getting Started guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/recomputer_r1000_getting_started_node_red/). Steps to Create a Flow

<center><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/flowfuse/selectin.PNG" /></center>

1. **Open Node-RED Editor**:
   - Go to your instance and select the instance you just created.
   - Click on `Open Editor` to launch the Node-RED editor.

<center><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/flowfuse/openeditor.png" /></center>

2. **Install Required Nodes**:
   - You may not see the `random` node and `gauge` node by default. To install these:
   - Go to the top-right menu, select `Manage palette`.
   - Go to the `Install` tab.
   - Search for `Random` and `Dashboard` nodes and install them.

  - After adding the device, you will be presented with a Device Configuration.
  - Under the manual instructions, copy the provided code snippet. You will need these credentials to connect the device with the FlowFuse cloud.

<center><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/flowfuse/add_device2.PNG" /></center>

## Installing the Device Agent

On your reComputer terminal, run the following command to install the FlowFuse device agent:

```sh
sudo npm install -g @flowfuse/device-agent
```
### Configuring the Device Agent

1. **Create Configuration Directory**:  - Run the following command one by one to create the configuration directory and set the appropriate permissions:

```sh
   sudo mkdir /opt/flowfuse-device
   sudo chown -R $USER /opt/flowfuse-device
   sudo su
   cd /
   cd opt/flowfuse-device
```
2. Create and Edit Configuration File:**  - Open a new configuration file named `device.yml`:
   
```sh
nano device.yml
``` 
- Paste the copied device configuration into this file and save it by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`.

3. Run the Device Agent:  - Execute the following command to start the FlowFuse device agent:
   
```sh
flowfuse-device-agent --port=1881
```
Your device is now configured and connected to the FlowFuse cloud, ready for use.

## Deploying the Flow to a Device

To deploy the flow to your device, you need to create a snapshot of your Node-RED instance and push it to the reComputer terminal. Follow these steps:

### Create a Snapshot

1. **Navigate to the Application**:
   - Go to your FlowFuse application and select the instance you created.

<center><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/flowfuse/snapshot1.PNG" /></center>

2. **Select 'Snapshot'**:
   - Click on the `Snapshot` option in the instance menu.

<center><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/flowfuse/snapshot2.PNG" /></center>

3. **Create a New Snapshot**:
   - Since there are no snapshots yet, you need to create one.
   - Click on `Create Snapshot`.

<center><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-R1000/flowfuse/snapshot3.PNG" /></center>
