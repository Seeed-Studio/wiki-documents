```sh
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
- **Add this line and save it.**

```sh
systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=false
```
- **Open this file**
```sh
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```
- **Add this line end of the phrase and save it.**

```sh

systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=false apparmor=1 security=apparmor
```
### Step 4: Install OS-Agent (ver. 1.3)
Download the suitable OS-Agent based on your CPU architecture, and then proceed to install it: **For Raspberry pi 64 bit OS is linux aarch64**.

```sh

This will ensure stable power delivery and optimal performance for the Coral USB Accelerator, enhancing its compatibility and effectiveness.

- Change frigate.yml file with below source code

```sh
mqtt:
  enabled: False
  
detectors: # <---- add detectors
  coral:
    type: edgetpu
    device: usb

cameras:
  RPIcam: # <------ Name the camera
    ffmpeg:
      input_args: preset-rtsp-udp
      inputs:
        - path: rtsp://192.168.8.151:8554/stream # <----- The stream you want to use for detection
          roles:
            - detect
    detect:
      enabled: True # <---- disable detection until you have a working camera feed
      width: 1280 # <---- update for your camera's resolution
      height: 720 # <---- update for your camera's resolution
      fps: 5
```

- Restart the Frigate addon . Then click on Frigate icon on the side bar. Next click on the stream and you will be have full view of the stream. By default you can detect person and you can draw a bounding box.
