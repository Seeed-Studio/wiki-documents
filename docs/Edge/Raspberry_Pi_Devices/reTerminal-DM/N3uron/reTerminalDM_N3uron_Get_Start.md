## Usage 

N3uron was designed with a microservice-oriented architecture in which each module runs as an independent process and Bootstrap is the core service that manages the rest of the processes. By default the **WebUI** module is automatically activated, making it accessible as soon as the installation is complete, additional functionalities are enabled creating new module instances.

Each module requires a valid license to run in production mode. If a module doesn‚Äôt find a valid license, it will run in demo mode for two hours. To restart the demo period, the module must be restarted.

Let's utilize the WebVision module to craft our first HMI experience, enhancing the visualization capabilities of our reTerminal DM.


## Introducing WebVision to reTerminal DM


WebVision is a self-contained, pure web HMI/SCADA interface tailored for industrial applications. Built entirely on JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS technologies, WebVision offers unparalleled flexibility, enabling users to seamlessly control their applications across a myriad of devices such as smartphones, tablets, touchscreens, laptops, desktop computers, and control room video walls.

Designed as an all-in-one solution, WebVision eliminates the need for external applications‚Äîeverything you need comes straight out of the box. From monitoring and control to data collection and analysis, WebVision sets the standard for efficiency and convenience.
For more information, please visit our dedicated website for WebVision in our [Knowledge Base](https://docs.n3uron.com/docs/web-vision).

### Instantiate a WebVision module

**Step 1:** Open N3uron and navigate to the Config menu.

**Step 2:**  Click on Modules, then create a new module. This instance can be given any name (except names with special characters like ‚Äò.‚Äô, ‚Äò/‚Äô, etc.), although users are recommended to name instances in a similar way to the name of the module being instantiated for easy identification. In this example, the WebVision module has been selected and has also been named WebVision.

**Step 3:** Navigate to the main configuration of WebVision and choose the appropriate server settings. The default settings should suffice for most use cases. For further details, please refer to the following link: [WebVision Initial Configuration](https://docs.n3uron.com/docs/web-vision-configuration).


<center><img width={1000} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/N3uron/Image_6.png" /></center>

**Step 4:** Once the WebVision module has been instantiated, the first step is to assign permissions to the roles previously created in the Roles section of WebUI. By default, two roles exist: Administrator for administrative access and User for regular access. You can add users to these roles or create new ones as needed. Once roles are established, set permissions for Designer and Viewer roles accordingly. 
Additionally, establish a Tag filter path for each role. Tag filter path access determines which tags from the tag model will be accessible for visualization by the corresponding role. In this case, we will assign the complete path of the tag model to both roles.


- Administrator:
    - Designer: Edit
    - Viewer: View
    - TagFilterPath:
        - Mode: Include
        - Path: /
        - Regex pattern: .*
- User:
    - Designer: None
    - Viewer: View
    - TagFilterPath:
        - Mode: Include
        - Path: /
        - Regex pattern: .*

**Step 5:** To test our initial WebVision screen, let's create a tag. Go to the WebUI, select **Config**, and then click on **Tag**. In the **Model** section, click on the menu and choose **New Tag**. Name it **TestTag**, for instance, select the type as **Number**, grant it **Read-Write permission**, initialize it to 0 (optional) and then save the settings.

<center><img width={1000} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/N3uron/Image_10.gif" /></center>

**Step 8:** Change the background color of the Main container. 

<center><img width={1000} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/N3uron/Image_11.gif" /></center>


**Step 9:** Inside the Main container, navigate to Components and add a new component. For this example, select the Gauge component.

<center><img width={1000} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/N3uron/Image_12.gif" /></center>

**Step 10:** Within the Gauge component, select the tag that will provide the values displayed on the gauge component.

<center><img width={1000} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/N3uron/Image_13.gif" /></center>

**Step 11:** Next, navigate to WebVision in the Config section and click on Open UI.
Log in using your Administrator credentials.

<center><img width={1000} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reTerminalDM/N3uron/Image_14.png" /></center>

**Step 12:** To test our simple design, navigate to the WebUI and select Data > Realtime. Change the value of TestTag. Afterwards, return to the WebVision UI and verify if the value displayed by the Gauge component has been updated.
