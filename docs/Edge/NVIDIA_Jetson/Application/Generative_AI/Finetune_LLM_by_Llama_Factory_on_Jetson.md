# Custom Local LLM: Fine-tune LLM by Llama-Factory on Jetson


## Introduction

🚀Finetune LLM by Llama-Factory on Jetson! Now you can tailor a custom private local LLM to meet your requirements.

</div>

Llama-Factory provides a highly convenient large language model fine-tuning tool that supports common large language models, datasets, and fine-tuning methods. With this platform, we can easily customize private large language models.

In this wiki, we will learn how to deploy Llama-Factory on Nvidia Jetson and use Llama-Factory to train a large language model that supports Chinese Q&A.


## Prerequisites

- Jetson device with more than 16GB of memory.
- Monitor, mouse, keyboard and network. (not necessary)

:::note
We have already tested the feasibility of this wiki on reComputer [Orin NX 16GB](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4012-p-5586.html) and [AGX Orin 64GB](https://www.seeedstudio.com/NVIDIArJetson-AGX-Orintm-64GB-Developer-Kit-p-5641.html) Developer Kit.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Connection

1. Connect the Ethernet cable to the reComputer (Powered by Jetson).
2. Connect the mouse, keyboard, and monitor to the reComputer.
3. Power on reComputer.

### Install Jetson-Examples

:::note
The [jetson-examples](https://github.com/Seeed-Projects/jetson-examples) by Seeed Studio offers a seamless, one-line command deployment to run vision AI and Generative AI models on the NVIDIA Jetson platform.
:::

To install the package, please open the terminal in Jetson and run:

```bash
pip3 install jetson-examples
sudo reboot
```

### Install and Run Llama-Factory on Jetson

Deploy `Llama-Factory` by jetson-examples in one-line:

```bash
reComputer run llama-factory
```

<div align="center">
    <img width={800} 
     src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/Llama-Factory/run_llama_factory.png" />
</div>

We can then open a web browser and access the address to open the WebUI:
```bash
# http://<jetson-ip>:7860
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

### Start Training

Here, we use the `alpaca_zh` dataset to fine-tune the `Phi-1.5` model, enabling it to have Chinese conversational capabilities. Therefore, in the web UI, we only configure the training `Model name` and `Dataset`, keeping the other training parameters as default. 

<div align="center">
    <img width={800} 
     src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/Llama-Factory/run_train.png" />
</div>

Finally, click the `start` button to initiate the training.

<div align="center">
    <img width={800} 
     src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/Llama-Factory/training.png" />
</div>

:::note
The training process will take approximately 18 hours.
:::

After completing the fine-tuning, you can find the fine-tuned model in the save directory.

</div>

### Testing the Fine-tuned Model.


Finally, we can use Llama-Factory with the fine-tuned model to test if it indeed has acquired Chinese conversational capabilities. The specific steps are as follows.


**Step1.** Load the fine-tuned model by Llama-Factory WebUI.

<div align="center">
    <img width={800} 
     src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/Llama-Factory/load_model.png" />
</div>

**Step2.** Enter a Chinese prompt in the `Input` text box, click the `Submit` button, and check the output result of the large language model in the `Chatbot` text box.

<div align="center">
    <img width={800} 
     src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reComputer-Jetson/Llama-Factory/test_model.png" />
</div>

From the test results, we can see that the fine-tuned model already has the capability to talk with human in Chinese. If you want your model to have more advanced capabilities, try using a more diverse set of fine-tuning data to train your model!
