## Introduction

Object detection, a fundamental aspect of computer vision, involves identifying objects within images and finds application in numerous fields such as surveillance, healthcare, and self-driving cars. Single-Stage Object Detectors are a specific category of models that simplify this task by directly predicting object categories and bounding box coordinates without requiring an initial region proposal stage. This streamlined approach is especially valuable in real-time applications. Notably, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models exemplifies this efficiency, offering fast object detection with compromising accuracy.

## Getting Started
Before you start this project, you may need to prepare your hardware and software in advance as described here.

### Hardware preparation

:::note

Before deploying a model on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi, it's often essential to conduct model conversion and quantization to ensure optimal performance. This process involves several steps: converting a PyTorch model (in .pt format) to a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model with quantization, specifically to the uint8 data type. You can train your custom dataset and convert it into a TFLite model using this Colab notebook. We have outlined a step-by-step process for training within the Colab environment. Please follow these instructions, obtain the **data.yaml** file and **best-int8.tflite** file, and return to this wiki for further guidance.

## Prepare your reTerminal DM

- **Step 1**  On Terminal execute these commands one by one.

```sh
sudo git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt 
sudo apt-get install python3-tflite-runtime
```
- **Step 2** Paste Data.yaml file and best-int8.tflite file inside yolov5 folder

## Inference with detect.py

- **Step 1** Open reterminal and navigate to yolov5 folder

```sh
cd yolov5
```
- **Step 2** Inference with detect.py

```sh
python detect.py --weight best-int8.tflite --img 224 --source <your source > --nosave --view-img --data data.yaml
```
:::note
You can explore the official Ultralytics GitHub site at [https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to learn how to use the `detect.py` script and discover the various sources you can utilize for feeding images or video streams into the YOLOv5 model.
