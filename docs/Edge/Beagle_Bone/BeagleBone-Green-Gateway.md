## Update to the Latest Software

You need to update the board to latest software to keep a better performance, here we will show you how to make it step by step.

**STEP1. Download the latest software image**

First of all, you have to download the suitable image here.

[![enter image description here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/BeagleBone-Green-Gateway/img/BBGG-download.png)](https://beagleboard.org/latest-images)

:::note
    Due to sizing necessities, this download may take about 30 minutes or more.
:::

The file you download will have an **.img.xz** extension. This is a compressed sector-by-sector image of the SD card.

**STEP2. Install the Image Burner**

Download the Open Source Flash burner [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). Download the version according to your operating system(Windows/macOS/Linux).

<div align="center"><img width="{500}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/BeagleBone-Green-Gateway/img/etcher.jpg"/></div>

**STEP3. Writing the OS Image into SD Card**

Select the downloaded image, select the MicroSD card and Flash!

<div align="center"><img width="{500}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/BeagleBone-Green-Gateway/img/bbgg-flash.png"/></div>

**STEP4. Boot your board off of the SD card**

Insert SD card into your (powered-down first) board. Then the board will boot from the SD card.

:::note
If you don't need to write the image to your on-board eMMC, you don't need to read the last of this chapter.  Otherwise please go ahead.
:::

If you desire to write the image to your on-board eMMC, you need to launch to the board, and modify a file.

In **/boot/uEnv.txt**:

    ##enable BeagleBone¬Æ Black: eMMC Flasher:
    #cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh
Change to:

    ##enable BeagleBone¬Æ Black: eMMC Flasher:
    cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh

Then you will find the user leds light as below

When the flashing is complete, all 4 USRx LEDs will be **off**. The latest Debian flasher images automatically power down the board upon completion. This can take up to **10 minutes**. Power-down your board, remove the SD card and apply power again to be complete.

## Grove for Seeed Studio BeagleBone¬Æ Green Gateway

Grove is a modular, standardized connecter prototyping system. Grove takes a building block approach to assembling electronics. Compared to the jumper or solder based system, it is easier to connect, experiment and build and simplifies the learning system, but not to the point where it becomes dumbed down. Some of the other prototype systems out there takes the level down to building blocks. Good stuff to be learned that way, but the Grove system allows you to build real systems. It requires some learning and expertise to hook things up.

Below listed the Grove modules that work well with Seeed Studio BeagleBone¬Æ Green Gateway.
