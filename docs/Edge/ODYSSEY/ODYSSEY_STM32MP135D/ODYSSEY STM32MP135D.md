## Getting started ##
### Hardware ###
To get started with the hardware, you will need the following:
* 1x ODYSSEY STM32MP135D,
* 1x usb-c to usb-a cable OR usb-c to usb-c cable,
* 1x ethernet cable,
* 1x usb to uart cable such as [this 
one](https://ftdichip.com/products/ttl-232r-rpi/).

First, carefully connect the usb to uart cable so you get access to the serial 
console. Refer to the following image to help you connect the pins 
properly.
![Top down view of STM32MP135D ODYSSEY board with debug pins next to the boot
jumper circled. Pins listed in order of closeness to boot jumpers: WAKE, GND,
TX, RX](https://wdcdn.qpic.cn/MTY4ODg1NTkyNTI4NTEyMg_558688_ff47Pijnl_CdTY5i_1689582643?w=1201&h=801&type=image/png "highlighted uart0 pins")

We will use the usb-c for power in this guide. Connect one end of the usb-c 
cable to the board, then connect the other end to your computer. Plug the 
ethernet cable into eth1 port of the ODYSSEY, and the other end into your 
router or network switch.

### Software ###
This guide will use the following software components:
* [buildroot version 2023.02 or later](https://buildroot.org/download.html).
* The [buildroot external 
tree](https://github.com/xogium/buildroot-stm32mp135d-odyssey) to be used in 
conjunction with upstream buildroot.
* [snagboot](https://github.com/bootlin/snagboot), which is a set of utilities 
that helps with easier operation of DFU and usb mass storage. It consists of 
snagrecover which is intended to upload the fsbl and ssbl into the board's 
DRAM, and of snagflash which is designed to actually flash data onto persistent 
storage.

Note: please follow the instructions in the snagboot repository in order to set 
it up properly, this is out of scope for this guide.

#### Features ####
The external tree provides the following:
* A single stm32mp135d_odyssey_defconfig which builds a minimal and generic 
system consisting of tf-a, optee, u-boot, and the linux kernel for the boot 
chain. The userspace is minimal and consists of a simple busybox init system 
and shell.
	* This system can be used in the following ways:
		* Written and booted from the eMMC (if your hardware 
		has it)
		* Written and booted from a micro sd card.
		* Booted over NFS.
* A post-build script is used to provide an easily writable bootloader image 
for the eMMC. It combines -tf-a and FIP image together in a single file, meant 
to be written using DFU, into the boot regions of said eMMC.
* A genimage configuration generates two disk images:
	* emmc.img contains an u-boot-env partition to easily store the u-boot 
environment into, along with the rootfs. It is expected that the bootloader be 
stored into the eMMC boot regions via DFU.
	* sdcard.img is comprised of two copies of tf-a into fsbl1 and fsbl2 
partitions, respectively, along with one single fip partition which contains 
the FIP image. There is also an u-boot-env partition the same as in emmc.img, 
along with a single rootfs.
* The external tree provides an empty external.mk, Config.in and a 
packages directory to be used, should you wish to add additional options 
and content. Please refer to the corresponding section in the buildroot 
manual to learn more.

#### Getting the softwares ####
This example demonstrates getting buildroot and the required external tree, 
then setting them up to be used:

First install Buildroot's required dependencies. See:
[The buildroot user manual, chapter 2: System 
requirements](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement). 
Then, set up the source code:
```
wget https://buildroot.org/downloads/buildroot-2023.02.5.tar.gz
tar -xf buildroot-2023.02.5.tar.gz
mv buildroot-2023.02.5 buildroot
git clone https://github.com/xogium/buildroot-stm32mp135d-odyssey
```

#### Building ####
Once the source code has been set up correctly, you can proceed with the 
build:
```
cd buildroot
make BR2_EXTERNAL=/absolute/path/to/buildroot-stm32mp135d-odyssey stm32mp135d_odyssey_defconfig
make
```

If everything goes well, you should now have a successfully built 
system in the output/images directory of your buildroot tree.
```
ls -1 output/images
combined-tf-a-and-fip.img
emmc.img
fip.bin
rootfs.ext2
rootfs.ext4
rootfs.tar
sdcard.img
stm32mp135d-odyssey.dtb
tee.bin
tee-header_v2.bin
tee-pageable_v2.bin
tee-pager_v2.bin
tf-a-stm32mp135d-odyssey.stm32
u-boot.dtb
u-boot-nodtb.bin
zImage
```

#### How to use the system ####
##### eMMC boot #####
Remove the middle boot jumper on the board to be sure DFU mode is active. Make 
sure to open the serial console using minicom or another similar program, you 
will need it.

As an example, here is how to use gnu screen to access a serial console 
named ttyUSB0. The baud rate is expected to be 115200n8.
```
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200n8
```

Then, execute the following command from the snagboot package and be
prepared to interrupt the boot sequence when reaching u-boot, by
pressing any key in the serial console window:
```
cd output/images
snagrecover -s stm32mp13 -f ../../board/stm32mp135d-odyssey/utilities/stm32mp1-stm32mp135d-odyssey.yaml
```

Once at the u-boot prompt, type the following to enable the eMMC boot 
partition: ```mmc partconf 1 1 1 1```. This enables the first eMMC boot 
partition and ensure it is possible to boot from it, by modifying ext 
csd register 179. Then, type ```dfu 0``` to expose all the DFU alt 
settings to your host machine, including the eMMC boot regions. They can 
be listed using the dfu-util command:
```
dfu-util -l
Found DFU: [0483:df11] ver=0200, devnum=7, cfg=1, intf=0, path="3-3", alt=4, name="mmc1_boot2", serial="0021001A3232510937393835"
Found DFU: [0483:df11] ver=0200, devnum=7, cfg=1, intf=0, path="3-3", alt=3, name="mmc1_boot1", serial="0021001A3232510937393835"
...
```

Then, use the snagflash tool to write the combined bootloader image into 
both boot regions:
```
snagflash -P dfu -p 0483:df11 --dfu-keep -D 3:combined-tf-a-and-fip.img
snagflash -P dfu -p 0483:df11 -D 4:combined-tf-a-and-fip.img
```

Once this is done, reset the board and confirm that the eMMC boot now 
works as expected by putting the middle boot jumper back onto the board. 
It will error out at booting from mmc1 partition 0 given the user area 
is blank, but this is normal at this stage.

When you're back at the u-boot prompt again, type ```ums 0 1``` to 
expose the user area of the eMMC as a usb mass storage device to your 
host machine. Use lsblk to determine which device node it was assigned, 
and replace sdX in the following command with the appropriate device 
node. Double check to ensure you will write on the correct device as it 
will be wiped entirely!
```
snagflash -P ums -s emmc.img -b /dev/sdX
```

When the writing has completed, press ctrl+c at the u-boot prompt to 
terminate the usb mass storage mode. Then, reset your board again, and 
confirm that it is now booting linux and that you get a login prompt. 
Log in with the root user and no password.

##### Micro sd card boot #####
If you wish to burn the system onto a micro sd card, please proceed as 
follows, replacing sdX with the appropriate device node:
```
sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M conv=fsync
```
Where sdX corresponds to the micro sd card device node. Refers to 
the output of lsblk command to make sure you get the correct device 
node! Otherwise, data loss will occure, as this erases the entire content of 
the target device.

Please use minicom or similar program to attach to the serial console of 
the board. As an example, here is how to use gnu screen to access a 
serial console named ttyUSB0. The baud rate is expected to be 115200n8.
```
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200n8
```

When the micro sd card has been successfully written to, insert it into 
the micro sd socket of the STM32MP135D ODYSSEY board, and adjust the boot 
jumpers to boot from micro sd (all jumpers removed). If required, reset the 
board. Log in with the user root and no password once you get the buildroot 
login prompt.

##### Nfs boot #####
To boot the system via NFS, please ensure to set up your /etc/exports as 
demonstrated, replacing the subnet / allowed ip addresses as needed, 
doing the same for the exported paths:
```
/srv/nfs 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,crossmnt,fsid=0)
/srv/nfs/stm32mp135d 192.168.1.0/24(rw,nohide,insecure,no_subtree_check,async,no_root_squash)
```

Also make sure your nfs server configuration enables UDP mode, like so:
```
/etc/nfs.conf
[nfsd]
...
udp=y
```

Extract the generated rootfs tarball in the appropriate directory, in this case 
/srv/nfs/stm32mp135d:
```
cd output/images
sudo mkdir srv/nfs/stm32mp135d
sudo bsdtar -xpf rootfs.tar -C /srv/nfs/stm32mp135d
```

Remove the middle boot jumper to be sure DFU mode is active. Make sure to open 
the serial console using minicom or another similar program, you will need it.
As an example, here is how to use gnu screen to access a serial console
named ttyUSB0. The baud rate is expected to be 115200n8.
```
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200n8
```

Then, execute the following command from the snagboot package and be prepared 
to interrupt the boot sequence when reaching u-boot, by pressing any key in the 
serial console window:
```
cd output/images
snagrecover -s stm32mp13 -f ../../board/stm32mp135d-odyssey/utilities/stm32mp1-stm32mp135d-odyssey.yaml
```

Once you're at the u-boot prompt, you can boot over nfs by doing the 
following:
```
setenv eth1addr 2c:f7:f1:30:2b:62
setenv ethaddr 2c:f7:f1:30:2b:62
dhcp
nfs ${kernel_addr_r} 192.168.1.92:/srv/nfs/stm32mp135d/boot/zImage
nfs ${fdt_addr_r} 192.168.1.92:/srv/nfs/stm32mp135d/boot/stm32mp135d-odyssey.dtb
setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rootfstype=nfs ip=dhcp nfsroot=192.168.1.92:/srv/nfs/stm32mp135d,tcp,v3 rw quiet console=ttySTM0,115200n8 earlycon
bootz ${kernel_addr_r} - ${fdt_addr_r}
```
Where 192.168.1.92 in this example is the machine hosting the nfs 
server. The MAC address set is also an example and not to be used in the 
real world. It is required due to having no MAC addresses defined in the 
OTP of the board, but can be stored semi-permanently in the EEPROM (see below). 
Log in with the user root and no password.

## EEPROM ##
### Layout ###
The current implementation to read MAC addresses from the EEPROM is 
expecting the first one to start at offset 0 and have a length of 6 
bytes. The second MAC must be stored at offset 0x10, and also have a 
length of 6 bytes.

* Tip: to generate random MAC, use a generator such as
[this one](https://www.hellion.org.uk/cgi-bin/randmac.pl).

For storing the u-boot environment into the EEPROM if you wish to do so, 
please ensure that the environment begins on a new page boundary. Pages 
are 64 bytes in size. For example, you could set the environment offset 
to 0x40, the size remaining at 0x2000, and redundant offset to 0x2080. 
Here's an example u-boot config fragment:
```
CONFIG_ENV_IS_IN_EEPROM=y
CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET=0x40
CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND=0x2080
CONFIG_I2C_EEPROM=y
CONFIG_SYS_I2C_EEPROM_ADDR=0x50
CONFIG_NVMEM=y
```

To apply it, run ```make menuconfig``` in the toplevel buildroot 
directory. Go to the bootloaders menu, scroll down to u-boot and modify 
the additional config fragments path, for example by inputting 
```$(BR2_EXTERNAL_STM32MP135D_ODYSSEY_PATH)/board/stm32mp135d-odyssey/configs/uboot.config```.

Then, please do a rebuild using ```make clean && make```.

Ultimately the layout is free for you to use, except for the MAC 
addresses location and length.

### How to use the EEPROM ###
To make use of the EEPROM on your board, you get access to it as a nvmem 
device, in both u-boot and linux. For example, lets write a MAC address 
in it:
```
printf '\x2c\xf7\xf1\30\x2b\x62'|dd of=/sys/bus/nvmem/devices/0-00501/nvmem bs=1
```

To store a second MAC address, do like so:
```
printf '\x2c\xf7\xf1\30\x2b\x63'|dd of=/sys/bus/nvmem/devices/0-00501/nvmem bs=1 seek=16
```
