# Installation of Mender Client on ODYSSEY - X86

We can setup Mender Client on an ODYSSEY - X86 board and then receive OTA updates from a Hosted or Self-Hosted Mender Server.

This guide focuses on using the ODYSSEY - X86 board running a custom Linux System compiled using the Yocto Project.

## Test results

The Yocto Project releases in the table below have been tested by the Mender community. Please update it if you have tested this integration on other [Yocto Project releases](https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases?target=_blank):

| Yocto Project | Build | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| dunfell (3.1 / 5.3.0) | test works | test works |

**Build** Means that the Yocto Project build using this Mender integration completes without errors and outputs images.
**Runtime** Means that Mender has been verified to work on the board. For U-Boot-based boards, the [integration checklist](https://docs.mender.io/devices/integrating-with-u-boot/integration-checklist?target=_blank) has been verified.

## Prerequisites

- A supported Linux distribution and dependencies installed on your workstation/laptop as described in the [Yocto Mega Manual](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#detailed-supported-distros)
  - NOTE. Instructions depend on which Yocto version you intend to use.
- [ODYSSEY - X86 board](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ODYSSEY-X86J4125800-p-4915.html)

## Configuring the build

### Setup Yocto environment

Set the Yocto Project branch you are building for:

Create a directory for your  `mender-seeed`  setup to live in and clone the
meta information.

```
mkdir mender-seeed && cd mender-seeed
```

Get all of necessary layers:

```
git clone -b dunfell git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky layers/poky
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-intel layers/meta-intel 
git clone -b dunfell https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender layers/meta-mender
git clone -b dunfell https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded  layers/meta-openembedded
git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/meta-odyssey-x86 layers/meta-odyssey-x86
```

### Setup build environment

Initialize the build environment:

```
source layers/poky/oe-init-build-env 
```

Add yocto project layers:

```
bitbake-layers add-layer  ../layers/meta-intel 
bitbake-layers add-layer  ../layers/meta-odyssey-x86 
bitbake-layers add-layer  ../layers/meta-openembedded/meta-oe 
bitbake-layers add-layer  ../layers/meta-openembedded/meta-python 
bitbake-layers add-layer  ../layers/meta-openembedded/meta-networking 
bitbake-layers add-layer  ../layers/meta-mender/meta-mender-core 
bitbake-layers add-layer  ../layers/meta-mender/meta-mender-demo 
```

Apply Mender configuration to build environment:

```
CONF_VERSION = "1"
MACHINE = "odyssey-x86-mender"
MENDER_ARTIFACT_NAME = "release-1"
INHERIT += "mender-full"
DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "sysvinit"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""
MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE = "/dev/sda"
MENDER_STORAGE_TOTAL_SIZE_MB_DEFAULT = "4096"
MENDER_BOOT_PART_SIZE_MB = "64"
MENDER_DATA_PART_SIZE_MB = "1024"
MENDER_IMAGE_BOOTLOADER_FILE = "wic-initrd"

IMAGE_FEATURES_append = " \
    ssh-server-openssh \
    "
```

in your local.conf.

### Configure Mender server URL (optional)

This section is not required for a successful build but images that are generated by default are only suitable for usage with the Mender client in [Standalone deployments](https://docs.mender.io/architecture/standalone-deployments?target=_blank), due to lack of server configuration.

You can edit the `conf/local.conf` file to provide your Mender server configuration, ensuring the generated images and Mender Artifacts are connecting to the Mender server that you are using. There should already be a commented section in the generated `conf/local.conf` file and you can simply uncomment the relevant configuration options and assign appropriate values to them.

Build for Hosted Mender:

```
# To get your tenant token:
#    - log in to https://hosted.mender.io
#    - click your email at the top right and then "My organization"
#    - press the "COPY TO CLIPBOARD"
#    - assign content of clipboard to MENDER_TENANT_TOKEN
#
MENDER_SERVER_URL = "https://hosted.mender.io"
MENDER_TENANT_TOKEN = "<copy token here>"
```

Build for Mender Demo Server:

```
# https://docs.mender.io/administration/demo-installation
#
MENDER_DEMO_HOST_IP_ADDRESS = "<IP address of Mender demo server>"
```

Build for Mender Production/ Self-Hosted (on-prem):

```
# https://docs.mender.io/3.1/system-updates-yocto-project/build-for-production
#
# Uncomment below and update the URL to match your configured domain
# name and provide the path to the generated server.crt file.
#
# Note that a custom server.crt file is only necessary if you are using
# self-signed certificates.
#
# NOTE! It is recommend that you provide below information in your custom
# Yocto layer and this is only for demo purposes. See linked documentation
# for additional information.
MENDER_SERVER_URL = "<URL of Self-Hosted Mender Server>"
FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend_pn-mender-client := "<DIRECTORY-CONTAINING-server.crt>:"
SRC_URI_append_pn-mender-client = " file://server.crt"
```

## Building the image

You can now proceed with building an image:

```
MACHINE="odyssey-x86-mender" bitbake odyssey-image-base
```

Replace `odyssey-image-base` with your desired image target.

## Using the build output

After a successful build, the images and build artifacts are:

- `build/tmp/deploy/images/odyssey-x86-mender/odyssey-image-base-odyssey-x86.uefiimg.bz2`

if you already have Mender running on your device and want to deploy a rootfs update using this build, you should use the [Mender Artifact](https://docs.mender.io/architecture/mender-artifacts?target=_blank) files, which have  `.mender`  suffix. You can either deploy this Artifact in managed mode with the Mender server (upload it under Releases in the server UI) or by using the Mender client only in [Standalone deployments](https://docs.mender.io/architecture/standalone-deployments?target=_blank).

## Flash instructions

There are two different methods of flashing the image and running on the ODYSSEY - X86 board.

**Method 1:** Flash to a USB Flash Drive connected to the ODYSSEY - X86 board and boot the system from the flash drive.

**Method 2:** Flash to an HDD/SSD connected to the ODYSSEY - X86 board and run from the HDD/SSD.

### Method 1

- **Step 1.** [Download balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) according to your operating system

- **Step 2.** Plug a USB Flash Drive to the PC

- **Step 3.** Click **Flash from file** and select `mender-seeed/build/tmp/deploy/images/odyssey-x86-mender/odyssey-image-base-odyssey-x86.uefiimg.bz2`file

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Mender/client/balena.png" alt="pir" width="600" height="auto"/></p>

- **Step 4.** Click **Select target** and choose the connected USB drive

- **Step 5.** Finally click **Flash**

- **Step 6.** Connect Flash drive to ODYSSEY - X86 board and turn on the board

- **Step 7.** While turning on the board, keep pressing **DELETE key** to enter **BIOS setup**

- **Step 8.** Go to **Boot** section and set the **Boot Option #1** to **UEFI: USB, Partition 1**

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Mender/client/UEFI.png" alt="pir" width="1000" height="auto"/></p>

- **Step 9.** Go to **Save & Exit** and select **Save Changes and Reset**

Now the OS will be successfully booted from the USB Flash Drive

### Method 2

- **Step 1.** Follow from **step 1 - step 9** in above **Method 1**

- **Step 2.** After booting successfully, turn off the board by executing:

```sh
poweroff
```

**Note:** We need to boot once after flashing because the **data** partition will grow to take up the remaining space on the flash drive, and we will use that space to store the image we need to flash to the HDD/SSD.

- **Step 3.** Remove the flash drive from the ODYSSEY - X86 and connect to the PC

- **Step 4.** Open a terminal window and copy the **uefiimg** from the Yocto compilation to the **data** partition of the flash drive

```sh
sudo cp mender-seeed/build/tmp/deploy/images/odyssey-x86-mender/odyssey-image-base-odyssey-x86.uefiimg /media/username/data
```

**Note:** Replace **username** with the username of your PC

- **Step 5.** Remove Flash drive from PC and connect to the ODYSSEY - X86 board. Also connect an external HDD/ SSD to the ODYSSEY board.

- **Step 6.** After the board is booted, type the following in the terminal window to list the disk partitions

```sh
fdisk -l
```

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Mender/client/partition.png" alt="pir" width="600" height="auto"/></p>

We can see that the connected HDD as **/dev/sdb**

- **Step 7.** Flash the **.uefiimg** file that we copied before to the connected HDD/SSD using **dd** utility

```sh
dd if=/data/odyssey-image-base-odyssey-x86.uefiimg of=/dev/sdb
```

**Note:** Replace **/dev/sdb** with the name corresponding to the connected HDD/SSD

- **Step 8.** Once flashing is done, poweroff the ODYSSEY - X86

```sh
poweroff
```

- **Step 9.** Remove the USB Flash drive and turn on the ODYSSEY - X86

- **Step 10.** While turning on the board, keep pressing **F7** to enter BIOS setup

- **Step 11.** Go to **BOOT** section and set the **Boot Option #1** to **UEFI: USB, Partition 1**

<p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Mender/client/UEFI.png" alt="pir" width="1000" height="auto"/></p>

- **Step 12.** Go to **Save & Exit** and select **Save Changes and Reset**

Now the OS will be successfully booted from the HDD/SSD
