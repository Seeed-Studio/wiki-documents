<div align="center"><img width="{1000}" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Home-Assistant-X86/thumb.png" /></div>


## Introduction

This wiki will walkthrough step-by-step on how you can turn your ordinary house into a smart one just by using an [ODYSSEY-X86](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ODYSSEY-X86J4125800-p-4915.html)! By the end of this wiki, you will be able to view a beautiful dashboard on your PC, tablet, smartphone, reTerminal and be able to control your home appliances and view other information such as sensor data right at your fingertips. So, let's get started!

## What is Home Assistant?

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) is a free and open-source software for home automation designed to be a central control system for smart home devices, which can be referred to as a smart home hub. It offers you home automation without needing the cloud, which means your home automation system is not dependent on remote servers or an internet connection. This local control means, you can have far better security than cloud connected devices. Also, it offers greater reliability when it comes to keep it running 24x7. 

<div align="center"><img width={1000} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Home-Assistant/1.png" /></div>

It is flexible to use and very easy to get started even for beginners with the great documentation offered by Home Assistant. Also, there is an active community on [Home Assistant Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io) with many members who will be there to help you if you come across any issues when building and running Home Assistant.

After setting up Home Assistant, it can be accessed through a web-based user interface by using companion apps for Android and iOS, or by voice commands via a supported virtual assistant such as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa.

## Different installation methods

Home Assistant is supported to run on different hardware such as a Raspberry Pi, ODROID, ASUS Tinkerboard, Intel NUC, Windows/ Linux/ Mac PCs. And with this, comes different methods of installation on different hardware. To learn more about all these installation methods please visit [this page](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation).

As you can see below, there are 4 main types of installation methods and not all Home Assistant features are supported by all installation methods.

<div align="center"><img width={650} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Home-Assistant/2.png" /></div>

## Installation Method for ODYSSEY - X86

According to Home Assistant, the two recommended methods of Home Assistant installation are **OS and Container method**. Here we will use **OS method** because it will give access to all the features of Home Assistant.

### Why not Home Assistant Container?

If we install Home Assistant Container on ODYSSEY-X86, we will be missing out on several Home Assistant features. So we will skip on that installation. However, if you want to explore this installation method, you can follow [this guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/generic-x86-64#install-home-assistant-container).

## Let's build it!

Now let's go through the process of installing Home Assistant OS on ODYSSEY-X86. 

There are different ways to install Home Assistant OS on ODYSSEY-X86. The most simplest way would be to directly flash the Home Assistant OS image to a USB flash drive, connect the USB drive to ODYSSEY-X86 and run Home Assistant from it.

The other way would be to install Home Assistant OS on a different storage device such as an external HDD, SSD, M.2 SSD and the onboard eMMC(for ODYSSEY-X86 eMMC version). This method can guarantee that you have a reliable storage device in comparison with a USB drive. 

We will explain how to install Home Assistant OS in both methods!

### Run Home Assistant from a USB flash drive

## View Home Assistant Dashboard UI in Kiosk mode on reTerminal

To be able to view the Home Assistant Dashboard UI on [reTerminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReTerminal-with-CM4-p-4904.html) LCD, we will use Chromium web browser which already comes with Raspberry Pi OS. We will set up Chromium so that it will autostart on full-screen mode after reTerminal is booted up.

- **Step 1.** Turn on reTerminal and make sure Raspberry Pi OS is already installed. If not, you can follow [this wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal-FAQ/#q2-how-can-i-flash-raspberry-pi-os-which-is-originally-shipped-with-reterminal).

- **Step 2.** Navigate to the following directory

```sh
cd /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/
```

- **Step 3.** Open **autostart** file with **nano text editor**

```sh
sudo nano autostart
```

- **Step 4.** Add the following line to the end of the file

```sh
@chromium-browser --kiosk --incognito --disable-pinch --overscroll-history-navigation=0 homeassistant.local:8123
```

- **Step 5.** Reboot reTerminal 

```sh
sudo reboot 
```

Now when reTerminal boots up, Home Assistant dashboard UI will open in full-screen window !
