# Reachy Mini Simulation - Setup Guide

You don't need a physical robot to start building! The Reachy Mini simulation runs on [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org) and provides a realistic physics environment to prototype, test, and debug your applications.

![Simulation](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ce846352192340e1de0c054dec19d4ca185f45a26d76c3f848e50f3707e8b19c/68747470733a2f2f7777772e706f6c6c656e2d726f626f746963732e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164646c6f6164732f323032352f30362f5265616368795f6d696e695f73696d756c6174696f6e2e676966)

## 1. Installation

:::danger Prerequisites
Before setting up the simulation, you must first complete the basic installation and virtual environment setup by following the **[Installation Guide](../../SDK/installation.md)**. This guide assumes you already have the Reachy Mini SDK installed and your virtual environment activated.
:::

The simulation requires the `mujoco` python bindings. You can install them alongside the Reachy Mini software with the extra tag `[mujoco]`.

:::tip With pip
```bash
pip install "reachy-mini[mujoco]"
```
:::

:::tip With uv
```bash
uv pip install "reachy-mini[mujoco]"
```
:::

## 2. Running the Simulation

To start the simulated robot, simply run the daemon command with the `--sim` flag:

:::tip Start simulation
```bash
reachy-mini-daemon --sim
```
:::

A window should open displaying the 3D view of the robot. You can interact with the view using your mouse (drag to rotate, right-click to pan, scroll to zoom).

### 🍎 Mac Users (Apple Silicon / Intel)

:::tip macOS specific
On macOS, MuJoCo requires a specific launcher to work correctly with the GUI. Instead of the command above, use `mjpython`:
:::

```bash
mjpython -m reachy_mini.daemon.app.main --sim
```

:::warning macOS Users
`uv` may have compatibility issues with MuJoCo on macOS. If you encounter installation or runtime problems, it's recommended to use `pip` directly instead of `uv` for MuJoCo-related packages.
:::

## 3. Dashboard and Apps

:::info
You can access the Dashboard at **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**.
:::

* **Apps:** You can install and run Apps! They will execute inside the simulation (e.g., the robot will move in the 3D viewer).

## 4. Scenes & Options

:::info Customization
You can customize the simulation environment using the `--scene` argument.
:::

* **`empty`** (default): Just the robot in a void.
* **`minimal`**: Adds a table and some objects (apple, croissant, duck) to play with.

:::tip Example
```bash
reachy-mini-daemon --sim --scene minimal
```
:::

## 5. Connecting your Code

Once the simulation is running, it behaves exactly like a real **Reachy Mini Lite** connected via USB. The daemon listens on `localhost`, and you can run any Python SDK script without modification:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

# Connects to the simulation running on localhost
with ReachyMini() as mini:
    print("Connected to simulation!")

    # Look up and tilt head
    print("Moving head...")
    mini.goto_target(
        head=create_head_pose(z=20, roll=10, mm=True, degrees=True),
        duration=1.0
    )

    # Wiggle antennas
    print("Wiggling antennas...")
    mini.goto_target(antennas=[0.6, -0.6], duration=0.3)
    mini.goto_target(antennas=[-0.6, 0.6], duration=0.3)

    # Reset to rest position
    mini.goto_target(
        head=create_head_pose(),
        antennas=[0, 0],
        duration=1.0
    )
```

## Next Steps

:::info Continue learning
* **[Python SDK](../../SDK/python-sdk.md)**: Learn to move, see, speak, and hear.
* **[AI Integrations](../../SDK/integration.md)**: Connect LLMs, build Apps, and publish to Hugging Face.
* **[Core Concepts](../../SDK/core-concept.md)**: Architecture, coordinate systems, and safety limits.
