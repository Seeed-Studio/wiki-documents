## 2. 🛜 First Boot & Wi-Fi Configuration

Once assembled, you need to connect the robot to your Wi-Fi network.

:::tip Step 1: Power On
Turn on your Reachy Mini.
:::

:::info Step 2: Connect to Reachy
Wait a few moments. The robot will create a Wi-Fi network named **`reachy-mini-ap`**.
* **Password:** `reachy-mini`
* *Or scan the QR Code:*

:::

:::tip Step 3: Configure Wi-Fi
* Open your browser and go to: **[http://reachy-mini.local:8000/settings](http://reachy-mini.local:8000/settings)**.
* Enter your local Wi-Fi credentials (SSID & Password) and click **"Connect"**.
* Wait a few moments for Reachy Mini to connect to your Wi-Fi network. The access point will disappear once connected. If the connection fails, Reachy Mini will restart the access point, and you can try again.
