# Using Reachy Mini Lite

The Lite version relies on your computer to run its intelligence. The central hub for this is the **Reachy Mini Control** application.

Check [this guide](./get_started) if you have not installed it yet.

## 1. Reachy Mini Control (Dashboard) 🖥️

When you open the application, you access the complete control panel for your robot.

* **Status & Visualizer (Left Panel):**
    * **3D View:** Shows the real-time position of the robot.
    * **Ready/Not Ready:** Indicates if the robot is correctly connected via USB.
    * **Sensors:** Monitor the microphone input and speaker volume.
    * **Logs:** See technical details and connection events at the bottom.

## 2. Applications & Demos 📱

You don't need to code to start having fun. The app comes with an integrated ecosystem.

### Quick Actions
Located at the bottom right, these are built-in demos ready to launch instantly:
* **Expressions:** Make Reachy express emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).
* **Controller:** Teleoperate the robot using a game controller or sliders.

### Installing New Apps
To extend Reachy's capabilities with community-created behaviors:
1.  **Discover:** Click the **"Discover apps"** button. This opens the Hugging Face Spaces store.
2.  **Install:** Select an app (like a Game or a Conversation demo) and click "Install".
3.  **Play:** Once installed, the app will appear in your "Applications" list. Simply click **"Play"** to start it.

> **Note:** When an App is running, it controls the robot. Stop the app before trying to run your own Python scripts.

## 3. Coding with Python 🐍
