##  Features
---
*   Since Seeeduino Stalker is designed for use as a Wireless Sensor Network node, it would be incomplete without an accompanying weather-proof enclosure. Keeping that in mind, while redesigning the newer version of Seeeduino Stalker (revision from v1.0 to v2.0) we adjusted the PCB outline and the location of the screws such that it could fit in this enclosure. The enclosure is tough and has a water proof seal.

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Stalker_V3-Waterproof_Solar_Kit/raw/master/img/Waterproof_enclosure.jpg).

*   The top lid of the enclosure is kept transparent to mount a solar panel inside it.For more stability, the solar panel is stucked under the top lid of the enclosure as shown:

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Stalker_V3-Waterproof_Solar_Kit/raw/master/img/Stalker_kit_v3.0_1.jpg).

*   The 1050mAh lithium polymer battery can be put into the enclosure under the Seeeduino Stalker. You can fix it by using screws and plastic pillars.

!!!NOTE
    Please note that [UartSBee_V4](/UartSBee_V4 "UartSBee_V4") cannot be inserted into the Bee Series socket present on Seeeduino Stalker. The [UartSBee_V4](/UartSBee_V4 "UartSBee_V4") is intended for interfacing the other Bee modules (shown in the photo above) to a computer and cannot itself be be inserted into the socket meant for these other Bee modules. There is a separate 5 way pinheader present on UartSBee_V4 as well as Seeeduino Stalker for interfacing them to each other. This pinheader is composed of: VCC (to supply power to Stalker), TXD, RXD, DTR (for controlling Stalker's Reset signal) &amp; GND.**

##   Usage
---
<big>Getting Started</big>

If you are new to the "Physical Computing" world and if Seeeduino Stalker is the first physical computing platform you want to begin with, then we suggest you to start with [ Seeeduino](/Seeeduino-Stalker_v3 "Seeeduino-Stalker v3").

The following steps will help you assemble the hardware and software resources to get you started with Seeeduino Stalker v3

**Step 1: Acquiring the Hardware**

You will require the following hardware for running your first program.

|---|---|
|**Mini USB Cable**<br>You would probably have this one lying around,or if not, buy one [here](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/mini-usb-cable-110cm-p-252.html). We would use this to connect the UartSBee_V4 to one of the USB ports on your computer.|**6 pin dual-female jumper wire**<br>Required for connecting the UartSBee_V4 to Seeeduino Stalker.You might already have few lying around your workspace. If not, you can buy a colourful one [here](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/6-pin-dualfemale-jumper-wire-100mm-5-PCs-pack-p-129.html).</div>

**Step 2: Installing the drivers and plugging in the hardware**

1.  [UartSBee_V4](/UartSBee_V4 "UartSBee_V4") is like the multi-purpose Swiss Army knife of the Physical Computing world. There is a very detailed procedure to use UartSBee_V4 for both Windows and GNU/Linux users [here](/UartSBee_V4 "UartSBee_V4").  In our case it will perform three functions:
    *   Allow us to program the Seeeduino Stalker.
    *   Allow us to communicate with Seeeduino Stalker.
    *   Provide power (from USB power of your computer) to Seeeduino Stalker (including any peripherals connected to it).

2.  The first two functions of UartSBee_V4 (programming and communication) are achieved through an Integrated Circuit called FT232RL which is present on it. Before FT232RL can be used for these purposes, its drivers (certain freely available programs from FT232RL's manufacturer) must be installed on your windows/ubuntu based PC. So before proceeding further, download the driver setup file [from here](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/CDM/CDM20802_Setup.exe) and install it on your Windows PC.

3.  UartSBee_V4 has an onboard voltage regulator and a switch to allow you to select what voltage (5.0V or 3.3V) you would like to supply to the target circuit board. In our case the target circuit board is Seeeduino Stalker and so you would need to set this slide switch to 5.0 volts

4.  The wiring connection scheme of our hardware is **"<font color="Navy">Computer</font><font color="Grey">→(Mini USB Cable)→</font><font color="Navy">UartSBee </font><font color="Grey">→(Flat Ribbon Cable)→</font><font color="Navy">Seeeduino Stalker</font>"**. The jumper wires must be connected between UartSBee_V4 and Seeeduino Stalker before connecting the UartSBee_V4 to the Computer.  Refer the photos below and make sure the signals line up as shown in the table (**Note: The TXD and RXD pins must be cross connected as shown in the table**).

5.  Next connect the Mini USB cable from UartSBee_V4 to your computer. If you are using a Windows based PC, the "Found New Hardware" balloon will pop up and within a few moments the drivers for FT232RL (i.e. UartSBee_V4) will be installed.

<big>Connection Notes </big>

*   **Bee series socket** - 2*10 pin 2.0mm pitch (which will mate with - one at a time - any of the [wireless modules](/Wifi_Bee "Wifi_Bee"): [XBee](/Zigbee_Networking_with_XBee_Series_2_and_Seeeds_Products "Zigbee Networking with XBee Series_2 and Seeeds Products"), [BluetoothBee](/Bluetooth_Bee "Bluetooth Bee"), [GPSBee](/GPS_Bee_kit "GPS_Bee_kit") or [RFBee](/RFbee_V1.1-Wireless_Arduino_compatible_node "RFbee V1.1 - Wireless Arduino compatible node").) Communication with these modules are done through UART.
*   **Serial interface** – To save space and lower costs, USB&lt;-&gt;Serial connectivity is not provided by default. You may use the FT232 based [UartSBee_V4](/UartSBee_V4 "UartSBee_V4") or other USB to serial adapter boards to do the programming or communicate with the PC.
*   **User LED** – An LED has been provided onboard for use in your application as desired.
*   **I<sup>2</sup>C Interface**: Onboard I<sup>2</sup>C level shifter IC provides voltage translation between 3.3V and 5V devices. This allows you to connect 5.0 Volt I<sup>2</sup> ICs to you microcontroller when its operating on 3.3 Volts.

##   Programming Examples
---
*   Download and install the DS1337 library and sketches available in the resources section. DS1337 library includes modified version DateTime class by Jean-Claude Wippler at [JeeLabs](http://jeelabs.net/projects/cafe/wiki/)

*   The datalogger demo sketches makes use of the Arduino SD Library.

<big>Adjust Date/Time</big>

*   Set Arduino board as `**Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (3.3V, 8MHz) w/ ATmega 328**`.

*   Open **adjust.ino** example from DS1337 library

*   Set the current date/time using the DateTime Class object **dt** in the example:

    *   `DateTime dt(year, month, date, hour, min, sec,week-day(starts from 0 and goes to 6)); `

        *   **Ex:-** `DateTime dt(2015, 10, 1, 11, 43, 0, 4);`

*   compile and upload to [Seeeduino-Stalker v3](/Seeeduino-Stalker_v3 "Seeeduino-Stalker v3")

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Stalker_V3-Waterproof_Solar_Kit/raw/master/img/Seeeduino_Stalker_v3_adjust.png)

**adjust.ino output**

<big>Get Current Date/Time</big>

* * *

*   Set Arduino board as `**Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (3.3V, 8MHz) w/ ATmega 328**` .

*   Open **now.ino** example from DS1337 library

*   The current date/time is read from DS1337 using ` RTC.now() ` function.

    *   **Ex:- ` DateTime now = RTC.now();`**

*   compile and upload to [Seeeduino-Stalker v3](/Seeeduino-Stalker_v3 "Seeeduino-Stalker v3")

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Stalker_V3-Waterproof_Solar_Kit/raw/master/img/Seeeduino_Stalker_v3_now.png)

**now.ino output**

<big>DS1337 Interrupts</big>

This example is a demonstration of interrupt detection from DS1337 <span style="text-decoration: overline">INT</span> output. This feature is useful for data-logger functionality where the MCU is put to sleep mode when not in use and DS1337 <span style="text-decoration: overline">INT</span> wakes up the CPU periodically. This extends battery power. The complete operation is documented in the code.

*   Solder P3 jumper.

    *   This connects the DS1337 interrupt out pin to ATmega328 INT0 pin.

*   Set Arduino board as `**Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (3.3V, 8MHz) w/ ATmega 328**`.

*   Open **interrupts.ino** example from DS1337 library

*   compile and upload to [Seeeduino-Stalker v3](/Seeeduino-Stalker_v3 "Seeeduino-Stalker v3")

**interrupts.ino output**

<big>Data Logger Example</big>

* * *

The principal application of Seeeduino Stalker v3.0 is data-logging of sensor signal like battery voltage, etc along with the time-stamp. These sketch puts the MCU in sleep mode when not performing data sampling / logging operation. The complete implementation is documented very well in the code. The following section gives an overview :

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Seeeduino_Stalker_V3-Waterproof_Solar_Kit/raw/master/img/Seeeduino_Stalker_v3_SolarPanel.jpg)

**Data Logger examples hardware setup**

1.  **StalkerV30_DataLogger_10Sec.ino**

    *   This sketch logs battery voltage data to SD card configured by **`RTC.enableInterrupts(_h, m, s_)`** function.
    *   The _periodicity_ is provided using h, m and s. Once an interrupt is detected, the next interrupt time is updated by advancing the h,m and s value. The DateTime Class comes handy for this.

        *   ex:- `interruptTime = DateTime(interruptTime.get() + interruptInterval);  //decide the time for next interrupt`

        *   This sketch also produces verbose output i.e the various events happening inside MCU are displayed in serial terminal.
