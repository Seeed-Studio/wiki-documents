## Getting Started

### Step 1: Familiarize the tools that we are using. 

<div class="all_container">
  <div class="getting_started">
      <div class="start_card_wrapper">
          <a href= "/sscma" class="getting_started_label2">1 SenseCraft AI Platform</a>
          <br/>Use pre-made tinyML models and experiment quickly.
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Step 2: Experiment tinyML models with pre-built arduino library

<div class="all_container">
  <div class="getting_started">
      <div class="start_card_wrapper">
          <a href= "/sscma" class="getting_started_label2">2 The AI "Blink" </a>
          <br/>Learn how to easily deploy public AI model libraries on edge devices. 
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Step 3: Make your own tinyML project by collecting data and training your own. 

<div class="all_container">
  <div class="getting_started">
      <div class="start_card_wrapper">
          <a href= "/train_and_deploy_model" class="getting_started_label2">3 Build Your own project </a>
          <br/>Learn how to easily train and deploy your own models.
