##  1.Product Introduction


![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Sensecap-LoRaWAN-Gateway-and-Wireless-Sensor-User-Guide/raw/master/img/1-1.jpg)


SenseCAP is an industrial wireless sensor network that integrates easy-to-deploy hardware and data API services, enabling low-power, long-distance environmental data collection. SenseCAP includes several versions, such as LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, etc.  
  
SenseCAP LoRaWAN version products include LoRaWAN Gateways and Sensor Nodes. Based on the LoRaWAN protocol, it can realize one-to-many, long-distance networking and bilateral communication. The LoRaWAN Gateway supports Ethernet and 4G. The Sensor Node is powered by a high-capacity battery that lasts up to 3 years (if uploading data once every hour). It also supports hot-swap, making it easy for maintenance and upgrading.  

SenseCAP provides an easy-to-use cloud platform. Users can scan the QR code with the SenseCAP App to bind the device with its respective account to manage the devices, and check Sensor Node data on the SenseCAP Portal. SenseCAP Portal provides API for users to further develop based on the data on the Portal.

**Main Features**

At the bottom of the gateway are Ethernet port and power connector, all of which meet the waterproof requirements. LED indicator light indicates the networking status. The top of the gateway is the connector for installing 4G/LoRa antenna, and the other connectors are reserved.


**LoRaWAN Sensor Node:**

Snap to open the device and you will see two parts. The Sensor Node Controller’s circuit shows a power switch, a RESET button, and an indicator LED as well as a mode button and serial ports, which will be used for firmware upgrading. The two parts connect and communicate via two spring connectors.
