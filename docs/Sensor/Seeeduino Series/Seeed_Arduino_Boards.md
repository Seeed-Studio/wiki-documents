## Step 3. Board Manager

Click on **Toos > Board > Board Manager**.

Now you can search the board by name, if you need to use `LinkIt ONE`, then just search `LinkIt`; and if you need to use `RePhone Series`,
just tap `RePhone`. In this wiki, we will take `Seeeduino Stalker V3` example.

Click Seeeduino Stalker V3 then an **Install** button appear, click on it to finish the step, this process takes about 5 minutes to half an hour, which depend on the speed of your network.
