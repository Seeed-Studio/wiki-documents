RF Explorer is a remarkable diagnostic tool used for monitoring and troubleshooting wireless systems and communications. It is a new series of low-cost, portable, RF spectrum analyzers designed by Ariel that are available in a variety of frequency ranges.

The RF Explorer series of analyzers and generators re-defines the handheld, portable RF spectrum analyzer. The unit is small and light-weight, yet offers performance and features comparable to larger, more expensive devices.

Whereas once the use of RF spectrum analyzers were limited to companies/organizations that could afford their high price tag, the low cost of the RF Explorer now offers every engineer, technician, and savvy hobbyist the opportunity to own an RF spectrum analyzer.

Below are software applications you might be interested in — they run on multiple platforms. This allows you to experiment with the various features provided by the software and determine which best fits your needs.
