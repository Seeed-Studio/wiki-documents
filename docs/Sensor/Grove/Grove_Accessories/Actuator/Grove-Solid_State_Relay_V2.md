Instead of using coil, packaged solid-state relays(SSR) use power semiconductor devices such as thyristors and transistors, which provide a much faster switching speed than the mechanical relays. The **Grove - Solid State Relay V2** is based on the high-quality **G3MC202P** module, which allows you to use a 5VDC to control MAX. 240VAC. With the help of Grove interface, it becomes very convenient to use the SSR with your arduino.

According to different application scenarios, we have prepared a series of solid state relays for you.

| Grove - Solid State Relay V2 | Initial                                                                                               | Aug 2018      |

## Features

- Advantages over mechanical relays:

  - Solid-state relays have much faster switching speeds compared with electromechanical relays, and have no physical contacts to wear out
  - Totally silent operation
  - No physical contacts means no sparking, allows it to be used in explosive environments, where it is critical that no spark is generated during switching
  - Increased lifetime, even if it is activated many times, as there are no moving parts to wear and no contacts to pit or build up carbon
  - Compact, thin-profile SSR of monoblock construction with an all-in-one lead frame incorporates a PCB, terminals and heat sink, which is much smaller than mechanical relays, and can integrate more channels

- Disadvantages:

  - When closed, higher resistance (generating heat), and increased electrical noise
  - When open, lower resistance, and reverse leakage current
  - Only works for AC laod

:::note
        You may pay attention to the **Leakage current**, 1.5mA is strong enough to drive Low power LED, so when the relay is off, the LED may still emits a faint light.

## Applications

- Operations that require low-latency switching, e.g. stage light control
- Devices that require high stability, e.g. medical devices, traffic signals
- Situations that require explosion-proof, anticorrosion, moisture-proof, e.g. coal, chemical industries.

## Hardware Overview

### Pin MAP

### Schematic

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Solid_State_Relay_V2/img/schematic_.jpg)

**K1** is the Relay module, When a  5V voltage is applied between the **INT+** and **INT-**, the relay will be turned on. Then the **LOAD1** will connect to the **LOAD2**.We use a NPN transistors **Q1**(BC817-40) to control the voltage between the **INT+** and **INT-**.

The **CTR** is the control signal from the Arduino or other board. It is pulled down by the 10k R2, if there is no signal, the 'Gate'(port 1) of **Q1** will be 0v, and Q1 is turned off, so that the K1 will be turned off. If **CTR** becomes 5v, then the Q1 will be turned on. **INT-** of k1 will be connected to the GND of the system, for the K1 there will be 5V between **INT+** and **INT-**, so the K1 will be turned on, and the **LOAD1** will connect to **LOAD2**.

#### Software

:::note
        If this is the first time you work with Arduino, we strongly recommend you to see [Getting Started with Arduino](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Arduino/) before the start.
:::

- **Step 1.** Open the Arduino IDE and create a new file, you can just click the icon ![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/wiki_english/docs/images/copy.jpg) in upper right corner of the code block to copy the following code into a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
uint8_t pin = 7;
void setup() {
  pinMode(pin, OUTPUT);}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);
  delay(5000);
  digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
  delay(5000);
}

```

- **Step 2.** Upload the demo. If you do not know how to upload the code, please check [How to upload code](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Upload_Code/).

:::tip
    You will see the on-board LED alternately lit and extinguished, and the Fan alternately turns on and off.
