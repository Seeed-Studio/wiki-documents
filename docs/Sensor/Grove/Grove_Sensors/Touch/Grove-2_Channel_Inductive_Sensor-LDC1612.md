The Grove - 2-Channel Inductive Sensor is based on Texas Instruments(TI) LDC1612, a 28-bit inductance to digital converter(LDC) for inductive sensing solutions. With multiple channels and support for remote sensing, the LDC1612 enables the performance and reliability benefits of inductive sensing to be realized at minimal cost and power. Inductance is an effect caused by the magnetic field of a current-carrying conductor acting back on the conductor. So by sensing the inductance, this sensor can detect the proximity of conductors especially metal nearby.

:::note
**1.** Set the Rb(resistance unit-kom), L(inductance unit-uH), C(capacitance unit-pf) by the APIs if you don't use the Coil Inductance we provided. Used to calculate and set the corresponding frequency register of the sensor.

**2.** There is an INT-pad on the sensor board, It turns to the low level when the conversion is complete, overwise stays high, but you should configure the corresponding register of the sensor.

## Working Principle

LDC1612 works based on measuring the parameters of the LC oscillator, formed by the PCB copper trace and the capacitor.

LDC1612 is able to measure the amount of energy it needs to provide to maintain the LC oscillation when a conductive object which is magnetically coupled with the LC oscillator approach. As the power loss of the oscillator circuit is proportional to the impedance of the conducting object, and the impedance value is affected by the distance of the object, it can then be used to determine the distance between the object and the LC oscillator. In this case, the PCB copper trace can be seen as an impedance sensor.

In basic_demo and muti_channel_demo examples, you may keep in mind that each output is corresponding to the intensity of inductance. There is the functional relationship between the output and the intensity of inductance, if you are interested in further information, you may want to refer to [Datasheet LDC1612](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-2-Channel_Inductive_Sensor-LDC1612/res/LDC1612.pdf) provided by Texas Instrument(TI).
