# Seeed Biomedical Sensors Selection Guide

We have released various types of Biomedical sensors in the recent years. You may find it difficult to make a choice between them. We feel your pain and let's take a close look at them and workout which one is best suited for you!

For all the Biomedical sensors in our bazaar, please click [Seeed Studio Bazaar](https://www.seeedstudio.com/) to check.

## What is a biomedical sensor

The biomedical sensor is a part of the sensor in the field of calibrated biomedicine, and is a conversion device that converts the physiological information of the human body into electrical information having a certain functional relationship therewith. The information it picks up is the physiological information of the human body, and its output is often expressed in electrical signals.

|GSR             | GSR sensors help us measure sweat gland activity related to emotional agitation. We use the electrical properties of the skin to measure GSR. In other words, the skin resistance changes with sweat gland activity, which is, sweat gland activity occurs, the more sweating, the smaller the skin resistance. |
| EMG                  | EMG detector is a bridge connects human body and electrical, the sensor gathers small muscle signal then process with 2th amplify and filter, the output signal can be recognized by Arduino. |
| Heart Rate              | The heart rate sensor uses optical technology to detect the amount of blood oxygen in the subcutaneous capillaries to detect the corresponding human heart rate, so that the module can easily and conveniently measure the heart rate. The heart rate sensor uses optical technology to detect the heart rate of the human body through changes in the amount of blood oxygen in the subcutaneous capillaries. Heart rate detection can be widely used in scenarios such as wearable devices and fitness auxiliary equipment.|
| Fingerprint                    | A fingerprint sensor is a sensing device, which belongs to an optical fingerprint sensor and a semiconductor fingerprint sensor, and is a key device for automatic fingerprint collection.|

## Field of Applicaitons

There are a numerous use of these health-related sensors. Particularly, using these kinds of sensors, human beings can be monitored and saved from potential dangers. Hence the biomedical sensors play important roles in various sectors, which include industry, medical, social applications, and domestic applications for monitoring body feature of people.

| Field of application                                          | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Examples of detected sensors                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hospital  | Monitoring heart rate of patients in avoidance of being in danger and give advice for health. | Heart rate, EMG, GSR|
