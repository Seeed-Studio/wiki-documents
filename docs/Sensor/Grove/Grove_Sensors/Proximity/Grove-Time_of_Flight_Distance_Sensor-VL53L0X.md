Grove - Time of Flight Distance Sensor-VL53L0X is a high speed, high accurary and long range distance sensor based on VL53L0X.

The VL53L0X is a new generation Time-of-Flight (ToF) laser-ranging module housed in the smallest package on the market today, providing accurate distance measurement whatever the target reflectances unlike conventional technologies. It can measure absolute distances up to 2m, setting a new benchmark in ranging performance levels, opening the door to various new applications.

The VL53L0X integrates a leading-edge SPAD array (Single Photon Avalanche Diodes) and embeds ST’s second generation FlightSenseTM patented technology.

The VL53L0X’s 940 nm VCSEL emitter (VerticalCavity Surface-Emitting Laser), is totally invisible to the human eye, coupled with internal physical infrared filters, it enables longer ranging distances, higher immunity to ambient light, and better robustness to cover glass optical crosstalk.

:::caution
    The platforms mentioned above as supported is/are an indication of the module's software or theoritical compatibility. We only provide software library or code examples for Arduino platform in most cases. It is not possible to provide software library / demo code for all possible MCU platforms. Hence, users have to write their own software library.
:::

## Getting Started

:::note
    If this is the first time you work with Arduino, we strongly recommend you to see [Getting Started with Arduino](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Getting_Started_with_Arduino/) before the start.

#### Software

- **Step 1.** Download the [VL53L0X Library](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove-Ranging-sensor-VL53L0X) from Github.

- **Step 2.** Extract the `Grove-Ranging-sensor-VL53L0X-master.zip` file into the `Arduino library folder`.

:::note
  For example, I download this library into `D:\Software\WorkWork\arduino-1.8.5\libraries`,so only need to extract the zip file here. All in all, please make sure the `Grove-Ranging-sensor-VL53L0X-master` folder is in your Arduino library folder, like the picture below.
:::

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Time_of_Flight_Distance_Sensor-VL53L0X-/img/folder.png)

- **Step 3.** Open the `Grove-Ranging-sensor-VL53L0X-master\examples` folder you've just extracted, you will see five subfolders:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Time_of_Flight_Distance_Sensor-VL53L0X-/img/examples.png)

Choose different example according to your own needs. Then double click the `xxx.ino` file to open the Arduino IDE.

:::note
  We use `high_accuracy_ranging.ino` in this demo.
:::

- **Step 4.** Upload the demo. If you do not know how to upload the code, please check [How to upload code](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Upload_Code/).

- **Step 5.** Open the **Serial Monitor** of Arduino IDE by click **Tool-> Serial Monitor**. Or tap the ++ctrl+shift+m++ key at the same time. if every thing goes well, you will get the result.

The result should be like:

```
time of mesurement: 205
Measured distance:115 mm
