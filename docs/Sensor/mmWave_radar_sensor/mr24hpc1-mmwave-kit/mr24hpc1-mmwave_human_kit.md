## Hardware Overview

Before everything starts, it is quite essential to have some basic parameters of the product. The following table provides information about the characteristics of mmWave Human Detection Sensor Kit.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/hardware.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::tip
There are some things to keep in mind when using this kit.

1. The network function of the XIAO ESP32C3 requires the use of an antenna. If you want to install a Grove module, try not to change the position of the antenna. The antenna is placed on the back of the baseboard by default, which ensures a good signal and does not interfere with the radar work.

2. The holes reserved in the kit shell are ventilation holes, which are reserved in consideration of the fact that users may use the sensor module for some gases, they are not used as a criterion to judge whether there are people or not, so please don't worry about the privacy issue.

## Getting Started

:::tip
All of this tutorial focuses on the quick application of the kit in Home Assistant & ESPHome, if you want to use the kit for secondary development, please refer to the [Customized secondary development](#customized-secondary-development) section of the tutorial.
:::

### Software Preparation

In this routine, we will not expand on how to install the Home Assistant environment, we will assume that you already have a working Home Assistant device.

If you wish to learn how to install Home Assistant, then you can refer to the [official tutorial](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/). We strongly recommend that you install Home Assistant using an x86 device as this is the most user friendly way for you to install Home Assistant with Supervised.

<div align="center"><img width={600} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/homs-xiaoc3-linkstar/77.png" /></div>

According to the table above, it is most appropriate to install **Home Assistant OS** and **Home Assistant Supervised**, which will take a lot of hassle off your hands.

We have also written how to install Home Assistant for some of Seeed Studio products, please refer to them.

- [Getting Started with Home Assistant on ODYSSEY-X86](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ODYSSEY-X86-Home-Assistant/)
- [Getting Started with Home Assistant on reTerminal](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reTerminal_Home_Assistant/)
- [Getting Started with Home Assistant on LinkStar H68K/reRouter CM4](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/h68k-ha-esphome/)

In addition to this, the XIAO ESP32C3 relies on the open source project ESPHome to access Home Assistant, so you also need to have the **ESPHome** service installed in the **Add-Ons**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/2.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

## Getting Started with ESPHome

Out of the factory kit, the XIAO ESP32C3 has been flashed with firmware that is ready to power up, and we were able to get the kit working on Home Assistant in a very short time. The video below will show you the exact steps to get started quickly.

<iframe class="youtube-video-r" src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/2.mp4" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" border="0" frameborder="no" framespacing="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

Below are the graphic step-by-step details, please refer to the following to complete the quick start.

### Step 1. Powering the kit

Please supply power to the kit via a USB-C type cable. Be careful that the power input does not exceed 5V/1A, otherwise the product may be damaged.

### Step 2. Connect to the kit's hotspot "seedstudio-mr24hpc1"

After the kit is powered on, a hotspot named **seedstudio-mr24hpc1** will be opened automatically, please search and connect to the hotspot. You can use your cell phone to connect to this network so you don't have to switch networks on your computer as often.

:::note
If you are using an older version of firmware, then this may require you to enter your WiFi password in order to connect to **mmwave-kit**. we recommend **[updating your firmware](#restore-factory-firmware)**. If you want to continue, the network password is `seeedstudio`.
:::

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/40.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then use your browser to go to the backend administration address: `192.168.4.1`. This is where we will configure the network and password that the kit needs to connect to.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/4.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then, select the name of the network you want the kit to connect to. Please note that the network you select needs to be on the same LAN as Home Assitant, otherwise your kit will not be recognized by Home Assitant searches.

:::caution
If you can't find the network you want to connect to on the page, it's likely that the XIAO ESP32C3 doesn't support your network. Please adjust your router yourself to enable maximum compatibility and make sure the network is on the 2.4GHz band.XIAO does not support networks on the 5GHz band.
:::

Enter the correct WiFi password and click Save. The device will automatically reboot and try to connect to the network you configured. You don't need to stay on this page, you can close it now.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/5.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Step 3. Adding your device to Home Assistant

If the networking goes well, you'll be able to find your device on Home Assistant. Please follow the path below to add your device. 

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/41.png" style={{width:500, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Click **Settings** in the menu bar and select **Devices & services**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/42.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

You should see the device appear in the **Discovered** section, click the **CONFIGURE** button. Select **SUBMIT** in the window that pops up afterwards and configure the region to use the device normally.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/43.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The kit was then successfully added to Home Assistant.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/44.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::note
If you have too many devices in your home, there is a certain probability that your device will not be found in Discovered. Then, please get the IP address of the kit from your router's console, click the **Add Integration** button at the bottom right corner, and manually enter the IP address to add the device.
:::

### Step 4. Adding components to the dashboard

Then, we click on the added **ESPHome** card, **1 device** here.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/45.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

This will show all the component content we have written for the kit. Let's scroll down the display area slightly to add all of these components to the dashboard.

:::caution
If you don't find the components shown under this page, check the kit's power supply and logs. If you are using the computer function, some computers may not have USB ports that provide enough power support. If you make sure there is no problem with the power supply, please open the logs and send the detailed logs back to Seeed Studio's technical support.
:::

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/46.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

We can then see all the information and content in **Overview**.

### Step 5. Edit Dashboard

Currently, the display order of the dashboard component is automatic, which may not be conducive to observing and performing setup operations, so next we need to edit the dashboard to make its display more in line with its function.

In Overviw, click on the three dots with the triangles and then click on **Edit Dashboard**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/12.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

On the Edit page, click the three dots in the upper right corner again to select the **Raw Configuration Editor**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/13.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then please clear the code in the original editor, copy the code below and save it.

:::tip
The new firmware has been revised according to the documentation provided by ESPHome and each device has a unique MAC name. So the component names will not be the same. If you want to use the code below, please replace all the `{$DEVICE}` in the code with the name of your device. Your device name can be seen in the device entity in ESPHome.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/mmwave_kit/47.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>
