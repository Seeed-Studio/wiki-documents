## Getting Started ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

:::note micropython is still not released
As of August 9, 2024, the stable MicroPython firmware for the XIAO RP2350 is still awaiting release from Raspberry Pi.
You could use the preview-compiled micropython firmware from https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO2/.
:::

:::info attention
This page primarily focuses on MicroPython users. For those interested in learning SDK programming or advanced users, you can visit [XIAO RP2350 with C/C++ SDK](/xiao-rp2350-c-cpp-sdk) to learn about setting up the environment and running example code.
:::

If your board doesn't have the firmware or you want to upgrade to a new version of MicroPython, you'll need to upload the `UF2` bootloader. For this step, please visit the [XIAO RP2350 with MicroPython](/xiao-rp2350-micropython) for detailed instructions on getting started with MicroPython on the XIAO RP2350.

:::tip about MicroPython

[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) is an interpreted language similar to [Python](https://www.python.org/). However, unlike Python, MicroPython runs directly on the hardware (bare-metal), providing an interactive prompt (REPL) to execute commands immediately, as well as the ability to run and import scripts from the built-in filesystem.

To connect to the XIAO RP2350 board and start writing and running your Python code, you can use any terminal tool that supports serial connections, such as minicom, PuTTY, electerm, warp, and more. For a more *user-friendly experience*, you can use **[Thonny](https://thonny.org/)** for its ease of use, integrated features, and beginner-friendly interface. This way, you can enjoy writing and running your Python code directly on the device.

If your device is ready with MicroPython, let's start with a simple project:

### Let's Make It Blink! ‚ú®

Getting the board to blink an LED is often the first program everyone runs. The same goes for the XIAO RP2350.

:::note
The `USER LED`, the yellow LED on the XIAO RP2350, is connected to `GPIO25/D19` according to the schematic diagram. 
For all XIAO family boards, the `USER LED` will **light up** when set to a `low level` and **turn off** when set to a `high level`.
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="MicroPython" default>

```python showLineNumbers
from machine import Pin # Import the Pin class from the machine module
from time import sleep  # Import the sleep function from the time module

# Initialize GPIO25 as an output pin, which controls the USER LED
led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT) 

# Turn off the LED initially
led.value(1) # led.on() -> high level -> light off
sleep(0.5) # Wait for 0.5 seconds

# Turn on the LED
led.value(0) # led.off() -> low level -> light on
sleep(0.5) # Wait for 0.5 seconds

# Enter an infinite loop
while True:
    # Toggle the LED state (on to off or off to on)
    led.toggle() 
    # Print the current state of the LED
    print(f"LED {'ON' if led.value() == 0 else 'OFF'}")
    sleep(0.5) # Wait for 0.5 seconds before the next toggle
```

Once you have copied the code into Thonny IDE, as shown in the image below, simply click the `Run current script` button or press `F5`. This will execute the code snippet and you'll see the LED on the XIAO RP2350 start to blink.

<!-- ### Play with RGB LEDs -->

<!-- Now that you've mastered the basics of blinking an LED, let's move on to controlling the RGB LED on the XIAO RP2350. -->

### Battery & Power Management

Is it possible to read the battery voltage without extra components? Yes, with the XIAO RP2350, it‚Äôs easier than ever. In previous XIAO family members, such as the [XIAO ESP32C3](/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/#check-the-battery-voltage), reading the battery voltage required manually connecting to *A0* with a resistor.

But with the XIAO RP2350, this process is simplified. You can now directly use the `A3/GPIO29` pin to read the battery voltage level, streamlining your design and development. Just remember to set the `GPIO19` pin to high, as it‚Äôs necessary to enable battery level reading.

Follow along with this code snippet to read the battery voltage using the Pico SDK:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="MicroPython" default>

```python
from machine import Pin, ADC
import time

# Function to initialize the GPIO pin for enabling battery voltage reading
def init_gpio():
    enable_pin = Pin(19, Pin.OUT)
    enable_pin.value(1)  # Set the pin to high to enable battery voltage reading

def main():
    print("ADC Battery Example - GPIO29 (A3)")
    
    init_gpio()  # Initialize the enable pin
    adc = ADC(Pin(29))  # Initialize the ADC on GPIO29

    conversion_factor = 3.3 / (1 << 12)  # Conversion factor for 12-bit ADC and 3.3V reference
    
    while True:
        result = adc.read_u16()  # Read the ADC value
        voltage = result * conversion_factor * 2  # Calculate the voltage, considering the voltage divider (factor of 2)
        print("Raw value: 0x{:03x}, voltage: {:.2f} V".format(result, voltage))
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Delay for 500 milliseconds

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

  <TabItem value="sdk" label="C/C++ SDK">

```c title='adc_bat.c'
#include <stdio.h>

#include "hardware/gpio.h"
#include "hardware/adc.h"

// Function to initialize the GPIO pin for enabling battery voltage reading
void init_gpio() {
    const int enable_pin = 19; // Pin to enable battery voltage reading

    gpio_init(enable_pin); // Initialize the pin
    gpio_set_dir(enable_pin, GPIO_OUT); // Set the pin as output
    gpio_put(enable_pin, 1); // Set the pin to high to enable battery voltage reading
}

int main() {
    stdio_init_all(); // Initialize standard input/output
    printf("ADC Battery Example - GPIO29 (A3)\n");

    init_gpio(); // Initialize the enable pin
    adc_init(); // Initialize the ADC

    // Initialize the ADC GPIO pin (GPIO29)
    adc_gpio_init(29);
    // Select ADC input 3 (corresponding to GPIO29)
    adc_select_input(3);

    while (1) {
        // 12-bit conversion, assume max value == ADC_VREF == 3.3 V
        const float conversion_factor = 3.3f / (1 << 12); // Conversion factor for 12-bit ADC and 3.3V reference
        uint16_t result = adc_read(); // Read the ADC value
        // Calculate the voltage, considering the voltage divider (factor of 2)
        printf("Raw value: 0x%03x, voltage: %f V\n", result, result * conversion_factor * 2); 
        sleep_ms(500); // Delay for 500 milliseconds
    }
