## Introduction

The Pico SDK represents a comprehensive software development kit tailored for the Raspberry Pi RP-family of microcontrollers, with a particular focus on the XIAO RP2350 board. This SDK incorporates a wide range of libraries and tools designed to facilitate the development of advanced applications, serving both novice enthusiasts and experienced professionals. The SDK functions as a foundational platform for exploiting the extensive capabilities of the RP2350 microcontroller across various projects.

## Prerequisites

Before initiating SDK programming on the XIAO RP2350, the following equipment is required:

- A USB Type-C cable
- The XIAO RP2350 board
- A personal computer equipped with a Linux/Unix operating system

:::caution Attention

This documentation predominantly addresses development under a Linux environment. Windows users are advised to consult the following resource for compatible setup instructions: [Raspberry Pi Pico Setup on Windows](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup-windows).

## Installation Guide ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

### Step 1: Install System Dependencies

Execute the following commands in your Linux terminal to install the essential system dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ git
```

### Step 2: üî® Toolchain Installation  {#install_gcc_arm}

To compile code for the RP2350, installation of a specific toolchain, `gcc-arm-none-eabi`, is imperative. This toolchain provides the necessary compilers and libraries for ARM architecture. Two methods for installation are provided below.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="manual_install" label="Option 1: Manual Installation" default>

The manual installation process offers precise control over the installation environment by following these steps:

1. **Download the Toolchain**:

   Access the ARM Developer Downloads page and download the `.tar.bz2` file for the `gcc-arm-none-eabi` toolchain from [here](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm).

2. **Extract the Archive**:

   After downloading, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory containing the file, and execute the command below to extract the archive:

   ```shell
   tar -xjf {downloaded-file}.tar.bz2
   ```

3. **Update System Path**:

   To make the toolchain accessible from any terminal session, add its directory to your system's PATH by inputting the following command, substituting `{VERSION}` with the actual version number of the toolchain:

   ```shell
   echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)/gcc-arm-none-eabi-{VERSION}/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. **Apply Configuration Changes**:

   To activate the PATH update immediately, source your `.bashrc` file:

   ```shell
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="script_install" label="Option 2: Scripted Installation">

Opt for a scripted installation to streamline and automate the setup process with the following steps:

1. **Download and Execute the Script**:

   Utilize `curl` to download the installation script and set the necessary execution permissions:

   ```shell
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seeed-Projects/Seeed-xiao-rp2350-sdk/main/install_gcc_arm.sh
   chmod +x install_gcc_arm.sh
   ./install_gcc_arm.sh
   ```

<details><summary>View Script Code</summary>

The script automates the download, extraction, and PATH configuration processes, as outlined below:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Handle the automatic download and installation of the gcc-arm-none-eabi toolchain
TOOLCHAIN_URL="https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/{VERSION}/gcc-arm-none-eabi-{VERSION}-linux.tar.bz2"
wget $TOOLCHAIN_URL -O toolchain.tar.bz2
tar -xjf toolchain.tar.bz2
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)/gcc-arm-none-eabi-{VERSION}/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
rm toolchain.tar.bz2
```

### Step 3: ‚õìÔ∏è SDK Installation  {#install_sdk}

The Pico SDK is crucial as it provides the libraries, examples, and documentation necessary for software development on the RP2350. It abstracts much of the hardware complexity through user-friendly APIs and is regularly updated to incorporate new features and performance enhancements.

#### Installation Instructions

To install the Pico SDK, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
echo "export PICO_SDK_PATH=$(pwd)/pico-sdk" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

These commands clone the SDK from its repository, set the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable to its location, and update your shell configuration to include this path, ensuring the SDK is accessible in your development environment.

:::tip Enhanced Setup on Raspberry Pi 4B or Pi 400

If you are developing directly on a Raspberry Pi 4B or Raspberry Pi 400, you can streamline the installation process with a setup script that automates these steps:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup/master/pico_setup.sh
chmod +x pico_setup.sh
./pico_setup.sh
```

This script configures your development environment specifically for the Pico on Raspberry Pi hardware, simplifying the initial setup and allowing you to focus on development.

#### Expanded SDK Download and Setup

<details><summary>Expand to view the detailed SDK setup script</summary>

For a more tailored SDK installation, especially if working with different shell environments, consider using the detailed setup script below:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Clone the appropriate Pico SDK repository
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git # should be pico-sdk-rp2350-a1
cd pico-sdk
PICO_SDK_PATH="$HOME/pico-sdk-rp2350-a1"

# Add the SDK path to your shell's configuration file
if [ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ]; then
    echo "export PICO_SDK_PATH=$PICO_SDK_PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
elif [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    echo "export PICO_SDK_PATH=$PICO_SDK_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
else
    # For other shells, adjust accordingly
    SHELL_CONFIG_FILE="$(basename $SHELL)rc"
    echo "export PICO_SDK_PATH=$PICO_SDK_PATH" >> ~/$SHELL_CONFIG_FILE
    source ~/$SHELL_CONFIG_FILE
fi

# Verify the environment variable setting
echo "PICO_SDK_PATH is set to ${PICO_SDK_PATH}"
```

This script ensures that the SDK path is correctly set up in your environment, regardless of the shell you use, and verifies that the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable is correctly set.

## Exploring the Examples and Building Projects

For newcomers to SDK programming, a practical approach involves studying the code of pre-existing Pico examples. This provides valuable insight into coding conventions and methodologies employed within the SDK environment.

### Steps to Execute the Code

The following steps outline the process from setting up the development environment to running your code on the XIAO RP2350 board:

1. **Development Environment Setup**: Initiate by configuring your development environment. Detailed instructions can be found on the [Setting Up the Pico SDK](/xiao-rp2350-c-cpp-sdk) documentation page. This setup is essential for ensuring that all necessary tools and libraries are correctly installed and configured.

2. **Code Composition**: Utilize a preferred text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop your application. For an initial test, you may start by writing the sample `blink.c` program, which toggles the board's LED. Save this file within your project directory.

3. **Code Compilation**:
   To compile your program, the Pico SDK offers a suite of tools streamlined for this purpose. Execute the following sequence of commands in your terminal, ensuring you are in the project directory where `blink.c` is located:

   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

   This process will generate a build environment, configure the project, and compile the source code into an executable format.

4. **Code Upload**:
   Upon successful compilation, a binary file with the `.uf2` extension is created in the `build` directory. This file must be transferred to the XIAO RP2350 board for execution. Connect the board via USB and copy the `.uf2` file to the device's mounted storage, typically appearing as a removable drive on your computer.

   After transferring the file, the XIAO RP2350 will automatically reboot, and you should observe the onboard LED blinking‚Äîindicating that the program is running effectively.

### Example 1: LED Blink

To demonstrate basic SDK usage, the following example details programming the onboard LED to blink:

```c title="blink.c"
#include "pico/stdlib.h"

const int sleep_time = 250;

int main() {
    const uint LED_PIN = PICO_DEFAULT_LED_PIN; // GPIO25
    gpio_init(LED_PIN);
    gpio_set_dir(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);
    while (true) {
        gpio_put(LED_PIN, 1);
        sleep_ms(sleep_time);
        gpio_put(LED_PIN, 0);
        sleep_ms(sleep_time);
    }
}
```
