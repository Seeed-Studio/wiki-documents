## Book outline

### [Chapter 1: Introduction to Hardware and Programming](https://mjrovai.github.io/XIAO_Big_Power_Small_Board-ebook/chapter_1.html)

In this chapter, readers start with basic programming on XIAO using Arduino IDE. Through simple example programs, they will learn to control LED lights, buttons, buzzers, and other electronic components, mastering core programming concepts like digital I/O, analog I/O, tone generation, and mapping values. By manually typing out code examples line-by-line, they will develop strong coding habits and grasp programming syntax.

### [Chapter 2: Project Practice for Beginners - Introduction to Prototype Design](https://mjrovai.github.io/XIAO_Big_Power_Small_Board-ebook/chapter_2.html)

In this chapter, readers will learn the basics of designing prototypes with XIAO through beginner-friendly projects. They will start from an idea and quickly create a verification prototype, focusing more on the practical application of code rather than line-by-line analysis. By leveraging Arduino libraries, community resources, and example programs, they will learn how to find and adapt code snippets to achieve desired effects efficiently. Furthermore, they will explore how to design the physical appearance of prototypes by creatively combining electronic hardware with everyday items. The key outcomes are grasping a project-based approach and developing skills to build simple interactive prototypes.
