### Software Preparation

This part has been described in detail in the [Basic Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/get_start_round_display#software-preparation), so you can jump directly to read it.


## Drawing simple dials using the TFT_eSPI library

TFT_eSPI is a feature rich Arduino IDE compatible graphics and fonts library for 32 bit processors. The TFT library provided by the XIAO Round Display is based on the library after the compatibility of XIAO and XIAO Round Display, which supports the use of the whole series of XIAO.

### Common Interfaces for TFT Library

#### 1. Create TFT objects

```c
TFT_eSPI tft = TFT_eSPI()
TFT_eSPI tft = TFT_eSPI(240,240)        // Set the screen size at the time of object creation
```

#### 2. Initialization

```c
void init(uint8_t tc = TAB_COLOUR)
void begin(uint8_t tc = TAB_COLOUR)
```

`tft.begin()` and `tft.init()` are two functions with the same function.

#### 3. Clear screen

```c
void fillScreen(uint32_t color) // Fill the screen with a certain color
```

#### 4. Setting the screen orientation

```c
void setRotation(uint8_t r);      // Set the display image rotation direction, r optional parameters for 0, 1, 2, 3
uint8_t getRotation(void)         // Read the current rotation angle
```

0, 1, 2, 3 represent 0¬∞, 90¬∞, 180¬∞, 270¬∞. Respectively, and 4 is the mirror image.

#### 5. Color Conversion

```c
uint16_t color565(uint8_t red, uint8_t green, uint8_t blue)    // Convert 8-bit red, green and blue to 16-bit
uint16_t color8to16(uint8_t color332)                          // Convert 8-bit color to 16-bit
uint8_t  color16to8(uint16_t color565)                         // Convert 16-bit color to 8-bit
uint32_t color16to24(uint16_t color565)                        // Convert 16-bit color to 24-bit
uint32_t color24to16(uint32_t color888)                        // Convert 24-bit color to 16-bit
```

#### 6. Color reversal

```c
void invertDisplay(bool i)      //i = true to invert all display colors, i = false to display normally
```

#### 7. Text-related settings

```c
/* cursor */
void setCursor(int16_t x, int16_t y)                     // Set the cursor for tft.print()
void setCursor(int16_t x, int16_t y, uint8_t font)       // Set the cursor and font size of tft.print()
int16_t getCursorX(void)                                 // Read the current cursor x position (moves with tft.print())
int16_t getCursorY(void)                                 // Retrieve the current cursor y position

/* font color */
void setTextColor(uint16_t color)                        // Set the color of characters only
void setTextColor(uint16_t fgcolor, uint16_t bgcolor, bool bgfill = false)   // Set the character foreground and background colors

/* font size */
void setTextSize(uint8_t size)                           // Set the character size multiplier (this increases the pixel size)
void setTextWrap(bool wrapX, bool wrapY = false)         // Turn on/off line feeds for text in TFT width and/or height

/* Text reference position */
void setTextDatum(uint8_t datum)                         // Set text reference position (default is top left corner)
uint8_t getTextDatum(void)                               // Get the text reference position

/* Set the background fill, which can be used to clear the display of the specified area */
void setTextPadding(uint16_t x_width)                    // Set the text fill (background margin/rewrite) width in pixels
uint16_t getTextPadding(void)                            // Get text fill
```

As you can see from the above functions, if you want to print the displayed text, you can simply use the  `tft.print()` function.

#### 8. Drawing of simple shapes

You can draw some simple shapes, including pixel points, straight line segments, rectangles, circles, etc. by using the following functions.

```c
drawPixel(int32_t x, int32_t y, uint32_t color)    // Plotting individual pixel points

drawLine(int32_t xs, int32_t ys, int32_t xe, int32_t ye, uint32_t color)  // Draw a line

drawRect(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t w, int32_t h, uint32_t color)   // Draw a rectangle
fillRect(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t w, int32_t h, uint32_t color)  // Draw a rectangle with a fill color

drawCircle(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t r, uint32_t color)  // Draw a circle
fillCircle(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t r, uint32_t color)  // Draw a circle with a fill color

drawEllipse(int16_t x, int16_t y, int32_t rx, int32_t ry, uint16_t color)  // Draw a ellipse
fillEllipse(int16_t x, int16_t y, int32_t rx, int32_t ry, uint16_t color)  // Draw a ellipse with a fill color

drawTriangle(int32_t x1,int32_t y1, int32_t x2,int32_t y2, int32_t x3,int32_t y3, uint32_t color)  // Draw a triangle
fillTriangle(int32_t x1,int32_t y1, int32_t x2,int32_t y2, int32_t x3,int32_t y3, uint32_t color)  // Draw a triange with a fill color
```

#### 9. Drawing of complex shapes

The TFT library also provides us with methods for drawing complex shapes, such as rounded rectangles, rounded arcs, silky smooth shapes, etc.

```c
/** 
    Draw a pixel blended with the background pixel colour (bg_color) specified,  return blended colour 
    If the bg_color is not specified, the background pixel colour will be read from TFT or sprite 
**/
drawPixel(int32_t x, int32_t y, uint32_t color, uint8_t alpha, uint32_t bg_color)

/** 
    Draw a small anti-aliased filled circle at ax,ay with radius r (uses drawWideLine)
    If bg_color is not included the background pixel colour will be read from TFT or sprite
**/
drawSpot(float ax, float ay, float r, uint32_t fg_color, uint32_t bg_color)


drawFastVLine(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t h, uint32_t color)  // Draw vertical straight lines
drawFastHLine(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t w, uint32_t color)  // Draw horizontal lines
drawWideLine(float ax, float ay, float bx, float by, float wd, uint32_t fg_color, uint32_t bg_color)  // Draw a thick solid line
drawWedgeLine(float ax, float ay, float bx, float by, float aw, float bw, uint32_t fg_color, uint32_t bg_color);  //Draws a tapered line. aw and bw represent the start and end width of the tapered line, respectively.


/**
    As per "drawSmoothArc" except the ends of the arc are NOT anti-aliased, this facilitates dynamic arc length changes with arc segments and ensures clean segment joints. 
    The sides of the arc are anti-aliased by default. If smoothArc is false sides will NOT be anti-aliased
**/
drawArc(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t r, int32_t ir, uint32_t startAngle, uint32_t endAngle, uint32_t fg_color, uint32_t bg_color, bool smoothArc);

/**
    Draw an anti-aliased (smooth) arc between start and end angles. Arc ends are anti-aliased.
    By default the arc is drawn with square ends unless the "roundEnds" parameter is included and set true
    Angle = 0 is at 6 o'clock position, 90 at 9 o'clock etc. The angles must be in range 0-360 or they will be clipped to these limits
    The start angle may be larger than the end angle. Arcs are always drawn clockwise from the start angle.
**/
drawSmoothArc(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t r, int32_t ir, uint32_t startAngle, uint32_t endAngle, uint32_t fg_color, uint32_t bg_color, bool roundEnds);

/**
    Draw an anti-aliased filled circle at x, y with radius r
    Note: The thickness of line is 3 pixels to reduce the visible "braiding" effect of anti-aliasing narrow lines this means the inner anti-alias zone is always at r-1 and the outer zone at r+1
**/
drawSmoothCircle(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t r, uint32_t fg_color, uint32_t bg_color)

/**
    Draw an anti-aliased filled circle at x, y with radius r
    If bg_color is not included the background pixel colour will be read from TFT or sprite
**/
fillSmoothCircle(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t r, uint32_t color, uint32_t bg_color)


/**
    Draw a rounded rectangle that has a line thickness of r-ir+1 and bounding box defined by x,y and w,h
    The outer corner radius is r, inner corner radius is ir
    The inside and outside of the border are anti-aliased
**/
drawSmoothRoundRect(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t r, int32_t ir, int32_t w, int32_t h, uint32_t fg_color, uint32_t bg_color, uint8_t quadrants)

/**
    Draw a filled rounded rectangle , corner radius r and bounding box defined by x,y and w,h
**/
fillSmoothRoundRect(int32_t x, int32_t y, int32_t w, int32_t h, int32_t radius, uint32_t color, uint32_t bg_color)
```

#### 10. Variables and text

In addition to simply displaying a specific string, sometimes we need to display some variables on the screen, such as time and sensor values, etc. Then, depending on the type of the variable, you can choose to use the following different functions.

```c
drawChar(int32_t x, int32_t y, uint16_t c, uint32_t color, uint32_t bg, uint8_t size)
drawNumber(long intNumber, int32_t x, int32_t y, uint8_t font) // Draw integer using specified font number. If no font is set (the last parameter, the default font)
drawFloat(float floatNumber, uint8_t decimal, int32_t x, int32_t y, uint8_t font), // Draw float using specified font number. If no font is set (the last parameter, the default font)
drawString(const char *string, int32_t x, int32_t y, uint8_t font),  // Draw string using specified font number. If no font is set (the last parameter, the default font)
```

#### 11. Image Processing

To use the `pushImage()` function to display an image on screen with the TFT library, you can follow these steps:

- Convert the image file to a C/C++ array format that Arduino can recognize. You can use online tools such as **Image2CPP** to convert a bitmap image to an array format.

- Include the generated image array file in your Arduino program.

- Initialize the TFT library and screen, set the screen resolution and color mode.

- Use the `tft.pushImage(x, y, width, height, data)` function to push the image data to the screen, where x and y are the coordinates of the top-left corner of the image, width and height are the width and height of the image, and data is the image array.

```c
// Image data array
const unsigned char image_data[] PROGMEM = {
  // Insert the converted C/C++ array data of the image here
};

tft.pushImage(x, y, image_width, image_height, image_data);
```

#### 12. TFT_eSprite class

`TFT_eSprite` and `TFT_eSPI` are both Arduino libraries for TFT LCD displays, but they have different functions and design purposes.

TFT_eSPI is a powerful library with many advanced features and configuration options that can achieve various display effects. It supports multiple display driver chips and controllers, and can be used on multiple Arduino hardware platforms. It uses the SPI interface and highly optimized code to achieve fast refresh rates and small code footprint. The TFT_eSPI library can be used for various applications including games, graphics, and GUI.

TFT_eSprite is a complement to the TFT_eSPI library and is mainly used for drawing small sprites on the display, such as game characters, icons, text, etc. TFT_eSprite can achieve faster drawing speeds because it caches images in memory and performs partial refreshes. This allows for faster refresh rates when updating small sprites and can save processor time and memory space.

Therefore, TFT_eSPI is a powerful general-purpose library suitable for multiple applications, while TFT_eSprite is a library that focuses on drawing small sprites and can provide higher drawing efficiency.

The general format for using the TFT_eSPI library is as follows.

```c
#include <TFT_eSPI.h>

TFT_eSPI tft = TFT_eSPI();

void setup() {
  tft.init();
  tft.setRotation(1);
}

void loop() {
    // Write the code to draw the graph
}
```

The general format for using the TFT_eSprite library is as follows.

```c
#include <TFT_eSPI.h>

TFT_eSPI tft = TFT_eSPI();
TFT_eSprite spr = TFT_eSprite(&tft);

void setup() {
  tft.init();
  tft.setRotation(1);
}

void loop() {
    spr.createSprite(128, 128);  // Create a sprite of 128*128 size

    // Write the code to draw the graph

    spr.pushSprite(0, 0);  // Placement of the drawn sprite
    spr.deleteSprite();
}
```

:::note
In the above example code, when the program exits the `loop()` function, `spr.deleteSprite();` is called to delete the TFT_eSprite object and release the memory space. This way, when creating a TFT_eSprite object in the next loop, the previously released memory space can be used to avoid wasting memory resources.
:::

For more information about the TFT library functions and its use, we recommend reading the **TFT_eSPI.h** and **TFT_eSPI.cpp** files in the library.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/1.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### About the TFT library customization options

Sometimes we need to use some custom font libraries or some features that are not enabled to save space. At this point we will need to modify the contents of the **Setup66_Seeed_XIAO_RoundDisplay.h** file.

- The default path for this file on **Windows** systems is: 

`C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI\User_Setups\Setup66_Seeed_XIAO_RoundDisplay.h`

- The default path for this file on **MacOS** systems is: 

`\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Arduino\libraries\TFT_eSPI\User_Setups\Setup66_Seeed_XIAO_RoundDisplay.h`

Please turn on or off some unnecessary functions according to the actual usage.
For example, if you want to use custom fonts, then you should uncomment `#define SMOOTH_FONT`, otherwise, you will probably get errors when running.

Of course, the header files of your custom fonts should be saved in the same directory as the ino files, which is a necessary step to circumvent errors.

### TFT-based dial sample program

We have written a dial program for the Round Display that can be used directly. Due to the memory space limitation of some XIAO models, this program only performs the basic hand movement function and is not designed for other functions. Users can use this program to learn the use of TFT library and the function of pointer movement, and complete the development of more complex dials according to the actual situation.

## Drawing simple dials using the LVGL library

The LVGL library is a general-purpose embedded graphics library that offers a rich set of graphical user interface controls such as buttons, labels, lists, etc. that can be used to build various user interfaces. Unlike the TFT library, the LVGL library provides an abstracted, object-oriented graphics interface that is easier to use and maintain, but may come with some performance and reliability trade-offs.

LVGL library is a very useful tool when building complex user interfaces that reduce the workload of writing and maintaining code. The TFT library, on the other hand, is more suitable for some applications that require high-performance graphics such as real-time image processing, video rendering, etc.

### Common Interfaces for LVGL Library

The LVGL library API is very rich and complex, and we hope that everyone who uses LVGL will take the time to read the official LVGL introduction documentation.

- [Get Started](https://docs.lvgl.io/latest/en/html/get-started/index.html)
- [Display interface](https://docs.lvgl.io/latest/en/html/porting/display.html)
- [Input device interface](https://docs.lvgl.io/latest/en/html/porting/indev.html)
- [Tick interface](https://docs.lvgl.io/latest/en/html/porting/tick.html)
- [Operating system and interrupts](https://docs.lvgl.io/latest/en/html/porting/os.html)

### Drawing complex UI interfaces with SquareLine Studio

In addition to reading the extensive LVGL official documentation and writing our own LVGL graphics programs, we can also use the official LVGL SquareLine Studio tool to improve our development efficiency.

Next, we will give you a brief introduction to the use of the software on the round screen, configuration methods, to help you can quickly get started using the software to design some interfaces.

:::caution
We recommend you to use the **v1.2.3** version of SquareLine Studio. After testing, the v1.3.0 version can have compatibility problems with the tft_eSPI library.

Environment used in the preparation of this tutorial:

1. **[TFT_eSPI library](https://github.com/limengdu/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-Round-Display-lvgl8.3.5/blob/main/libraries/TFT_eSPI.zip)** by Bodmer, version: **2.5.22**

2. **[LVGL library](https://github.com/limengdu/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-Round-Display-lvgl8.3.5/tree/main/libraries/lvgl)** by kisvegabor, embeddedt, pete-pjb, version: **8.2.0**

:::

#### Step1. Download the SuqareLine Studio

You can go to the official website of SquareLine Studio by clicking [here](https://squareline.io/), then click **TRY IT FOR FREE** to download the software to your computer.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/3.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

If your computer is using this software for the first time, then you will get a free 30-day trial, if not, the free version is also able to draw up to 5 pages, using 50 widgets.

:::caution
If you're a first-time user, please don't register to log into your account that has no balance, it could cost you the full 30-day trial!
:::

#### Step2. Configure screen interface information

Next, we can open the software and start by creating a blank display page.

Since we are using Arduino programming, then what we create also needs to be an Arduino file.

Our circular screen has a screen resolution of **240*240** and supports only **16bit** color depth. Other than that, the name and theme of the project need to be defined by you, here I'll use the dark style as the theme.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/4.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

What if you're too fast, like me, and forget to set the shape of the dial and create the project? No problem, in the upper left corner of the main interface, you can also find the Project Settings tab to make changes to the settings you just made.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/5.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::caution
Note that please complete your project setup before you officially start drawing and make sure it matches our screen specifications, otherwise everything you draw may not display properly on the screen.

Not everything can be modified after the project has been created, such as the project name. Please don't use any language other than English or special characters in the project name, and please don't use the **"-"** sign, please replace the **"-"** sign with **"_"**. Otherwise, the exported program may have errors during compilation!
:::

#### Step3. Understanding the functional layout of the software

Based on my usage habits, I have divided the main interface of the software into roughly the following parts.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/6.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

- **Hierarchy and Animation pane**: This one area allows you to set up different dial pages, display layers and animations.

- **Widgets**: Here you can choose what components to use to add on the display page. These components are integrated with the software and can be used directly. Components that are not available here will need to be added later in your own programming software.

- **Working Area**: In the workspace, you can change the position of certain components by dragging and dropping them. Even more conveniently, the final display will be consistent with what is shown in the workspace, so what you see is what you get.

- **Assets & Console**: Assets shows the image clips you have added, and these added image clips can be used in the components that support inserting images. Console will show you some error messages (if any) that occurred while setting up.

- **Setup Area**: The main purpose here is to configure the properties of the component.

We will first have a general knowledge of the software interface, and then we will take you through the practical understanding of the use of each part.

#### Step4. Use software to realize your ideas

Suppose I want to draw a music interface now. Of course, I like listening to music too much, so I want to draw a music display interface as an example.

I would like to have the following components in this music display screen.

- Album cover art of my favorite music as background.
- To have a play progress bar
- To have a volume control bar
- To have a play and pause button

After sorting out our requirements, we then need to design the display components from the bottom up, just like building a building.

The first step is to create a musical background image.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/7.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Select **Panel** in the widgets, you can click it and it will be automatically placed in the center of the dial, or you can drag it to the position of the dial you want to place it.

We will put the displayed image in the Panel instead of directly on the dial background because I don't like the whole dial to be this image, and the Panel can be resized freely.

At this point, you can see that there are already a series of properties in the Setup Area that we can set. The settings for each component are generally similar, with one or two options that may be a little different.

> **Name**: You should name the widget. There cannot be a number, underscore or a special character at the beginning of the name. Having exported the code, you can find the widget by that name.

> **Layout**: You can use a layout to automatically arrange the children of a widget. If the layout is enabled the children's X and Y value can't be adjusted manually, unless the `IGNORE_LAYOUT` or the `FLOATING` flag is enabled on the children.

##### Panel Usage

To sum up, if I need to display the album image in the top half of the dial, then I need to adjust the coordinates and size of the Panel and set the background image.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/8.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::note
In order to occupy as little memory as possible on the motherboard, please insert the picture as much as possible to the resolution of the dial to compress, do not let go of the large picture!
:::

Then we can set the transparency of the image in **Bg Image opa**. I don't want it to be completely opaque because a completely opaque image will affect the display of my text afterwards.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/9.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

It is worth noting here that all components have frame lines by default, so in order not to affect the aesthetics, we need to remove the frame lines. The way to do this is to set the transparency of the Border color to 0.

So, **if you want to remove any color or any line segment, you can do it by setting the transparency to 0**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/12.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

##### Label Usage

Then, we add text in the middle (use **Label** widgets), which shows the artist and the name of the song. In the style, we can change the font size, color and other content.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/10.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

##### Imgbutton Usage

Under the text, we add some playback components (use **Imgbutton** widgets), such as play/pause button and toggle up/down track button.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/11.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Imgbutton is a special kind of button, the biggest difference between it and the normal Button is that Imgbutton can be configured with three states of style before pressing the button, when pressing and after releasing the button respectively. This process is very similar to the scenario where we press to switch the play state. If you think the up/down button doesn't need such a complicated function, you can also use the Button directly.

Then we now set the Press and Release button images to the play style, and only in the Disable state is the pause style.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/13.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then we add an event, the function of this event is, when the user presses the button, then the state switches to Disable, so that the effect of the image switch is achieved.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/14.png" style={{width:500, height:'auto'}}/></div>

If you want to verify the effect, you can click on the play button at the top right of the workspace, and then you can click on the play button to see the effect of the switch.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/15.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

##### Arc Usage

Then we add the last component, which is the volume bar and the playback progress bar. We'll do this by using Arc.

For Arc, the main things we need to adjust are the color and size of the rings.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/16.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

- MAIN: This refers to the style design of the rectangular background behind the entire Arc. the **Arc** configured in the MAIN style is not indicative of the style of the arc area.

    <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/17.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

- INDICATOR: Refers to the style setting of the arc of the starting indication area. The **Arc** setting under INDICATOR is generally used.

    <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/18.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

- KNOB: This refers to the configuration of this circle on the image. If you don't need this circle, you can set its transparency to 0. The size of this circle, you need to set inside the Arc in INDICATOR.

    <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/19.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

This is the effect I want to achieve.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/20.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

If you have checked that it is clickable, then you can click the Run button and drag the arc, then you can achieve the effect of changing the volume bar.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/21.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

##### Screen Switch

With the music interface almost designed, we might as well add a new main interface next.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/22.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then design an event that switches the main screen to the music screen. For example, I design it here to switch to the music playback interface by swiping my finger right under the main interface.

Since the main interface is the main character, this event should be added to the main interface under Screen.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/23.png" style={{width:500, height:'auto'}}/></div>

If you want to have an animation effect that slowly switches after a slide, then Speed you can keep at 500, if you want to switch immediately, then Speed should be set to 0.

##### Pointer Animation

Back to the design of the main interface, we want to add the animation effect of the dial hand rotation.

The first thing to do is that you need to draw your own second, minute and hour hands. Then add it to the main dial in the style of **Image**.

The pointer position adjustment requires patience, as we need to make sure that the pointer is rotating around a fixed point on the picture.

Transform is set for image placement. The Pivot in the Image tab below sets the coordinates of the rotation point. The general way to set this is to first adjust the Transform to make sure the fixed point of the pointer is in the center of the dial, and then adjust the coordinates of the Pivot a little bit. When all the angles can make the pointer fixed point does not move, then these parameters are the most suitable.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/24.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Once you have all the pointer positions determined, you can start adding new animation effects. The animation effect settings for different pointers can be found in the following figure.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
	    <th>Second</th>
	    <th>Minute </th>
        <th>Hour</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/25.png" style={{width:300, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
	    <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/26.png" style={{width:300, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
        <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/27.png" style={{width:300, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Finally, we just set the animation of the pointer movement to play while the main screen loads.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/28.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::tip
The above tutorials have basically covered 80% of the software usage scenarios, and many of the other components are very similar. Finally, here are some tips and hints for you when using the software.

1. You need to place all components with touch functionality at the top, otherwise it will interfere with the implementation of the component's touch functionality.

    By default, the last component placed by the software is at the top. This means that in the Hierarchy tab, the components that are arranged next to each other tend to be at the top. In the music interface you just designed, the top layer is the Arc for adjusting the sound size, which causes a problem because the Arc is a rectangle that occupies the whole dial and will affect the touch of the play button, so normally you need to adjust the layer of the play button to the top of the Arc layer so that it will not affect the touch.

    <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/29.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

2. Turn off as many unneeded features as possible to save more memory.

    Every component will have some Flags checked by default, but not all of them are required. while the default ones won't be a problem, turning off the unwanted Flags will make your dial UI run more smoothly.

    Like the background album in the music interface, there is no need to click and no animation, and it is good to turn off the option in Flags. But close also need to consider the actual situation, for example, in the scene of sliding switch dial page, close the function of some Flags will make sliding disabled, so still need to run according to the effect of discretion to close.

    <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/30.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

3. Be sure to give a unique name to all your components and animations, events, etc.

    The software can only save you the time of drawing some patterns and animations, but more complex effects may require you to program them later to achieve. Then it's important to be able to quickly find where your components are located in the code. Naming components, events and animations is key!
:::

#### Step5. Export and application of programs

Once your dial UI is drawn, you can consider exporting the UI to a program and uploading it to XIAO via Arduino. Click on the top left corner of the software and click on **Export** -> **Create Template Project**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/31.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Then select the path to save and the code will be exported automatically. The exported project template will have the following files in it.

- libraries
- ui
- REANME.md

And what we need are the files under the ui folder. We can open the ino file directly under the ui folder. Then, we need to make changes to the following files to ensure that the program will compile smoothly.

- **ui.h**: The section that contains the library, only `#include "lvgl.h"` is kept.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
	    <th>Before modification</th>
	    <th>After Modification</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/32.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
	    <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/33.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
	</tr>
</table>

- **ui.ino**: Turn on the touch screen function and set the dial rotation direction.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
	    <th>Before modification</th>
	    <th>After Modification</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/34.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
	    <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/35.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
	</tr>
    <tr>
	    <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/36.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
	    <td><div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/37.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div></td>
	</tr>
</table>

Then you can choose which XIAO you use to compile and upload.

### About the LVGL library customization options

If you follow the steps above and still get some "Undefined" error messages during compilation, you may not have configured `lvconf.h` for customization.

To save memory on the motherboard, the lvconf.h file we provide disables some of the lvgl features. But if you use these functions in your dial drawing, you need to turn them on manually.

- The default path for the `lvconf.h` on **Windows** systems is: 

`C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Arduino\libraries`

- The default path for the `lvconf.h` on **MacOS** systems is: 

`\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Arduino\libraries`

As a simple example, in the above example, we use the `MONTSERRAT 8` font, but by default this font is turned off, so there may be an error during the compilation process.

Then all we need to do is to change the 0 after this font in the lv_conf.h file to 1, which means that the font is enabled.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/round_display_for_xiao/38.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

If you encounter a similar error, you can double-check that the customization feature is enabled.


### LVGL-based dial program

We have created two dial styles for the circular screen for users' reference. Due to the complex UI logic, this will require a certain amount of performance and memory on the XIAO motherboard. If your XIAO is compiling the following dial program with insufficient memory error, then you may need to upgrade your XIAO or reduce the functionality of the dials.
