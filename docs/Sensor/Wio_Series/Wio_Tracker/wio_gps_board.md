What is Wio Tracker? Wio Tracker is an Arduino compatible development board that helps you to track any moving things on the planet. By integrating GSM&GPRS as well as GPS&BeiDou in one board, it provides an all-in-one solution for your out-door IoT project.

If you are following the latest news about Low-Power Wide-Area Network(LPWAN), you may know that 2016 is a special year because there are new technology like LoRa and Sigfox came out, which remarkably pushed the development of WAN. The Wio Tracker has similarities as LoRa and Sigfox but also quite different. It is more suitable for out-door moving tracking and situations that has high frequency customer interaction and medium volume of data, for example sharing bicycle, logistics location, pet tracking.

Comparing to traditional GPS tracking solution, Seeed’s Wio Tracker is much more easier to use and customize for the fast changing IOT market. As a user-friendly Grove development board, the look of Wio Tracker may remind you of Wio Link, another started product of Seeed. So you can also find 6 grove connector on the board. As an Arduino compatible board, users can use the Wio Tracker with Arduino IDE directly.

Why do we call the Wio Tracker a solution, because it is really not just a board. At SeeedStudio, we have the ability to help customer customize the Wio Tracker for their own project and finish the project all the way to mass production. As Wio Tracker uses standard module that is mass production, we are ready to mass production even when customer is at their prototyping stage.

We have prepared everything, the last thing we need is your creative projects, so if you are making an out-door IOT tracking project, please don’t hesitate to use the Wio Tracker!

:::caution
    Please always plug 3.7V Lipo battery in case USB power supply is not sufficient.

## Getting Started - Arduino IDE

:::note
    This chapter is based on Win10 and Arduino IDE v1.6.0
:::
First you need to install the latest Arduino IDE, and [ADD Seeeduino SAMD to your Arduino IDE](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeed_Arduino_Boards/).

### Install the Driver (For Windows)

When the first time to insert the board, you should get a USB COM device name Wio Tracker that need to install a driver. Click [here](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_LoRa/res/driver.zip) to download driver for the board.



To make sure the driver was installed successful, open your Device Manager to see if **Wio Tracker** exists.

### Install the library of Wio Tracker(For Windows, Linux and Mac)

Click [here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Wio_GPS_Board/archive/master.zip) to download the library(zip file) of Wio Tracker and import the zip library into your Arduino IDE. If you are new to this, please click [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4) for more information.


### Blink

Different from other boards, there is an User LED SK6812 on Wio Tracker, which is an intelligent control LED light source and similar to ws2812b. Now we are going to upload our first demo - Blink to Wio Tracker, which will introduce how to use the User LED.

First, we have to install [Adafruit NeoPixel Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel/archive/master.zip)(for ws2812b LED) and import it into Arduino IDE.

Then open your Arduino IDE and click on **File > Examples > MC20\_GPS\_Traker > Blink** to open the sketch or copy the blow code:

```c
#include "MC20_Arduino_Interface.h"
#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>

#define RGBPOWER     6          //To use User LED, D6 should be HIGH.
#define RGBPIN       10
#define LED_NUM      1

Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels = Adafruit_NeoPixel(LED_NUM, RGBPIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);

void setup() {
  pinMode(RGBPOWER, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(RGBPOWER, HIGH);
  pixels.begin(); // This initializes the NeoPixel library.
}

void loop() {

  // For a set of NeoPixels the first NeoPixel is 0, second is 1, all the way up to the count of pixels minus one.
  // pixels.Color takes RGB values, from 0,0,0 up to 255,255,255
  pixels.setPixelColor(0, pixels.Color(0,0,100)); // Moderately bright blue color.
  pixels.show(); // This sends the updated pixel color to the hardware.
  delay(1000);   // Wait for 1 second
  pixels.setPixelColor(0, pixels.Color(0,0,0));   // Turn off the led.
  pixels.show();
  delay(1000);
}
```

And Then,

* Click on **Tools > Board > Wio Tracker**
* Click on **Tools > Port** to select a right port number. (*Don't choose COM1*)


Then click on the **Upload** button on the left-top of Arduino IDE, seconds later the sketch was uploaded successful.


If the uploading is success, you should the some info in red and you will see the User LED, it's blinking in blue.



### Check battery

Wio Tracker is designed for tracking moving things outdoor. So you can power the board via a 3.7V Lipo battery with JST1.0 connector and check the voltage of your battery easily.

:::caution
    Make sure the positive and negative end of your battery is connected right, otherwise the board may be damaged.
:::
Battery status pin had beed connect to A4, which allow you to measure voltage of the battery via coding.

Open your Arduino IDE and click on **File > Examples > MC20\_GPS\_Traker > Check_Battery** to open the sketch or copy the blow code:

```c
#include "MC20_Arduino_Interface.h"

const int pin_battery_voltage = A4;

void setup() {
    SerialUSB.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {

    int a = analogRead(pin_battery_voltage);
    float v = a/1023.0*3.3*2.0;        // there's an 10M and 10M resistor divider
    SerialUSB.print("The voltage of battery is ");
    SerialUSB.print(v, 2);
    SerialUSB.println(" V");
    delay(1000);
}
```

### Use Grove modules to expand your application

To use 6 Grove connectors on Wio Tracker, we have to use `digitalWrite(12, HIGH)` to open 3V3\_B to power the Grove modules(D12 defaults to LOW in order to reduce consumption).

* The following code shows how to use Analog and Digital Grove modules:

Open your Arduino IDE and click on **File > Examples > MC20\_GPS\_Traker > Button\_LightSensor** to open the sketch or copy the blow code:

```c
#include "MC20_Arduino_Interface.h"

#define GrovePowerPin   12
#define LightSensorPin  A0
#define ButtonPin       2


void setup() {
  SerialUSB.begin(115200);
  pinMode(ButtonPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(GrovePowerPin, OUTPUT);
  // write high to grove power pin to enable all the Grove ports,
  // or only Grove D2 port is usable.
  digitalWrite(GrovePowerPin, HIGH);   
}

void loop() {
    // print analog data when the button is pressed
    if (digitalRead(ButtonPin)) {
        SerialUSB.print("The value of light sensor:");
        SerialUSB.println(analogRead(LightSensorPin));
    }
    delay(500);
}   
```

* The following code shows how to use Grove UART port:

```c
#define GrovePowerPin   12

void setup() {
  pinMode(GrovePowerPin, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(GrovePowerPin, HIGH);    //power Grove
  //SerialUSB.begin(115200);
  SerialDBG.begin(115200);    //set Grove UART baud rate 115200
}

void loop() {  
  //SerialUSB.println("Grove UART is sending message");
  SerialDBG.println("This is Grove UART");
  delay(1000);
}
```

Please use [USB To Uart](https://www.seeedstudio.com/USB-To-Uart-5V%263V3-p-1832.html) to read the Grove UART port data.

:::caution
    If both SerialUSB and SerialDBG are used in the code, please open SerialUSB's com port when using, otherwise SerialDBG will not work.
:::
### GNSS

MC20 module provides the AT Commands Set for MCU to communicate with its GSM/GPRS, GNSS and Bluetooth modules.

And we have installed a well written library for the Wio GPS, for simple applications you even don't need to know much about how to use the AT commands, which is complex and hard to read.

The following example shows how to read longitude and latitude and print them out in Serial Monitor. Please note that Wio Tracker should be placed outdoor to get GPS signal. And this example needs a SIM card in Wio Tracker, the following pictures show how to install/uninstall a SIM card:

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio_GPS_Board/images/insertsim.jpg)

![](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio_GPS_Board/images/pullsim.jpg)

Open your Arduino IDE and click on **File > Examples > MC20\_GPS\_Traker > MC20\_GNSS > GNSS\_Show\_Coordinate** to open the sketch or copy the blow code:

```c
#include "MC20_Common.h"
#include "MC20_Arduino_Interface.h"
#include "MC20_GNSS.h"


GNSS gnss = GNSS();

void setup() {
  SerialUSB.begin(115200);
  // while(!SerialUSB);

  gnss.Power_On();
  SerialUSB.println("\n\rPower On!");

  while(!gnss.open_GNSS()){
    delay(1000);
  }

  SerialUSB.println("Open GNSS OK.");
}

void loop() {
  // gnss.dataFlowMode();

  if(gnss.getCoordinate()){
    SerialUSB.print("GNSS: ");
    SerialUSB.print(gnss.longitude, 6);
    SerialUSB.print(",");
    SerialUSB.println(gnss.latitude, 6);  
  } else{
    SerialUSB.println("Error!");
  }

  delay(1000);
}
```


### SMS Message Read

The following example shows how to read sms messages on Wio Tracker. Nano SIM card is needed in this example.

Open your Arduino IDE and click on **File > Examples > MC20\_GPS\_Traker > MC20\_SMSRead** to open the sketch or copy the blow code:

```c
#include "MC20_Common.h"
#include "MC20_Arduino_Interface.h"

#define RGBPIN 10

char phone[32];
char dateTime[32];
char buffer[64];
int i = 0;
char *s = NULL;
int inComing = 0;

GPSTracker gpsTracker = GPSTracker();

void setup() {
  // MC20_init();
  pinMode(RGBPIN, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(RGBPIN, LOW);
  SerialUSB.begin(115200);
  // while(!SerialUSB);

  gpsTracker.Power_On();
  SerialUSB.println("Power On!");

  // gpsTracker.deleteSMS(1);

}

void loop() {

  if(MC20_check_readable()){
    inComing = 1;
  }else{
    delay(1000);
  }

  if(1 == inComing){
    MC20_read_buffer(buffer, 64);
    SerialUSB.println(buffer);

    if(NULL != (s = strstr(buffer,"+CMTI: \"SM\""))) { //SMS: $$+CMTI: "SM",24$$
        char message[128];
        int messageIndex = atoi(s+12);
        gpsTracker.readSMS(messageIndex, message,128);
        SerialUSB.print("Recv SMS: ");
        SerialUSB.println(message);
     }
     MC20_clean_buffer(buffer,64);  
     inComing = 0;
  }

}
```

### Bluetooth Connection

It is also very easy to connect to your Bluetooth device on Wio Tracker. Open your Arduino IDE and click on **File > Examples > MC20\_GPS\_Traker > MC20\_BlueTooth > BT\_FastConnect** to open the sketch or copy the blow code.

Then change the deviceName of your Bluetooth device, Wio Tracker will connect it automatically.

```c
#include "MC20_Common.h"
#include "MC20_BT.h"

// GPSTracker gpsTracker = GPSTracker();
BlueTooth bt = BlueTooth();
int bt_state = -1;
char *deviceName = "N-612";


void setup() {
  SerialUSB.begin(115200);
  while(!SerialUSB);

  bt.Power_On();
  SerialUSB.println("\n\rMC20 power On!");
  bt.BTPowerOn();
  SerialUSB.println("\n\rBT power On!");

  while(IDLE != (bt_state = bt.getBTState())){
    SerialUSB.print("State: ");
    SerialUSB.println(bt_state);
    delay(1000);
  }

  bt.BTFastConnect(deviceName, HFG_PROFILE);
}

void loop() {
  /* Debug */
  if(SerialUSB.available()){
    serialMC20.write(SerialUSB.read());
  }
  if(serialMC20.available()){     
    SerialUSB.write(serialMC20.read());
  }
}
```

### SD Card

- **Step 1.** Plug SD card to Wio GPS board. 
- **Step 2.** Use the usb cable to connect Wio GPS board to PC. 
- **Step 3.** Open your Arduino IDE, Select **Tools** -> **Board** -> **Wio GPS board**.
- **Step 4.** Click on **File > Examples > Seeed_Wio_GPS_Board\SD_Card_Test_DumpFile** to open the sketch or copy the blow code.
- **Step 5.** Upload code to Wio GPS board, it shows how to read a file from the SD card using the SD library and send it over the serial port.

#include <SPI.h>
#include <SD.h>

const int chipSelect = 4;
char* fileName = "gps.txt";

void setup() {
  // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
  SerialUSB.begin(115200);
  while (!SerialUSB) {
    ; // wait for serialUSB port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }


  SerialUSB.print("Initializing SD card...");

  // see if the card is present and can be initialized:
  if (!SD.begin(chipSelect)) {
    SerialUSB.println("Card failed, or not present");
    // don't do anything more:
    return;
  }
  SerialUSB.println("card initialized.");

  // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
  // so you have to close this one before opening another.
  File dataFile = SD.open(fileName);

  // if the file is available, write to it:
  if (dataFile) {
    while (dataFile.available()) {
      SerialUSB.write(dataFile.read());
    }
    dataFile.close();
  }
  // if the file isn't open, pop up an error:
  else {
    SerialUSB.println("error opening datalog.txt");
  }
}

void loop() {
}
```
