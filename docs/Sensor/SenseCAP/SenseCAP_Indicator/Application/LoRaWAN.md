## Hands-On Demo

In this section, we'll delve into the SenseCAP Indicator's basic LoRaWAN(*Class C* & *OTAA*) functionality through a practical demonstration. The process is divided into three main steps:

1. [Obtain Firmware](#flash_firmware): Customize and install the firmware as needed.
2. [Registering the Device](#HEAD_register_device): Add your device to a LoRaWAN Network Server.
3. [Configuring LoRaWAN Credentials](#configure_credentials): Enter necessary network details on your SenseCAP Indicator.

Before we begin, let's get some background on LoRaWAN.

## LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN is described as a Low Power, Wide Area (LPWA) networking protocol that wirelessly connects battery-operated devices to the internet across large regions or networks. It's a part of the LoRa wireless system and operates in a license-free spectrum, supporting long-range communication with limited bandwidth. It is characterized by long-range communication (up to 10 miles), long battery life (up to 10 years), low cost, and low power usage with a payload size ranging from 51 to 241 bytes depending on the data[^1].

:::info Interested in custom firmware?
The [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v5.1/esp32/get-started/index.html#ide)(v5.1) provides insights on building your own. You can access and modify the [source code](https://github.com/Seeed-Solution/SenseCAP_Indicator_ESP32) to suit your specific needs.
:::



### 1.2 Flash Firmware:

To flash the firmware onto the SenseCAP Indicator, download it first and then use esptool (or `esptool.py` if you have an ESP-IDF environment) to flash it(for comprehensive guidance, refer to the [instructions](/SenseCAP_Indicator_Application_LoRaWAN)).

**Flashing firmware on Windows using esptool:**

Use the command below in the Windows command prompt to flash the firmware:

```jsx
<tool_path>/esptool.exe --chip esp32s3 --baud 921600 write_flash -z 0x0 <firmware_path>/indicator_lorawan.bin 
```

For example, if your `flash_bin` folder is located in drive `D:` and contains the following structure:

```sh
flash_bin/
├── esptool.exe
└── indicator_lorawan.bin
```

Your command will look like this:

```sh
./esptool.exe --chip esp32s3 --baud 921600 write_flash -z 0x0 ./indicator_lorawan.bin
```

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={680} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/esptool_nonport_flash.png.png"/>
</div>

If you have multiple ports and need to specify one, use the `-p` or `--port` argument:

```sh
./esptool.exe --chip esp32s3 -p COM20 --baud 921600 write_flash -z 0x0 ./indicator_lorawan.bin
```

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={680} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/esptool_port_flash.png"/>
</div>

:::note
Mac users should replace `./esptool.exe` with `./esptool`.

If you encounter issues during flashing, consider reducing the **baud speed** or refer to [these troubleshooting steps](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1411463/dev-ttyusb0-file-disappears-from-dev-directory-while-using-device).
:::

Once the firmware is successfully flashed, retrieve essential parameters like the Device EUI and APPkey from the LoRaWAN Network Server from the subsequent steps.

## Step 2. Register the Device on LoRaWAN Network Server {#HEAD_register_device}

> Before starting, ensure your device is within a LoRaWAN network's coverage area.

This section will guide you through connecting to a local LoRaWAN network server. We will use the [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/) platform as an example, alongside the [SenseCAP M2 Multi-Platform LoRaWAN Indoor Gateway (EU868)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Multi-Platform-LoRaWAN-Indoor-Gateway-SX1302-EU868-p-5471.html). *If you are employing a different network server, the procedure will be similar*; you'll need to collect the essential information for activation:

**Decoder Function**

Indeed, to make the payload data transmitted by your device meaningful and interpretable, it's essential to implement a decoder within the device profile. This decoder will translate the raw binary data into a readable format, allowing you to understand and utilize the information your device sends effectively.

<details>

<summary>Click to copy Decoder.js</summary>

The docoder is from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Seeed-Solution/SenseCAP_Indicator_ESP32/blob/main/examples/indicator_lorawan/docs/ChirpStackV4_Decoder.js)

```js
function decodeUplink(input) {
    var decoded = {
        data:[]
    };
    var type;
    var floatNumber;

    if ( (input.bytes.length  % 5) !== 0) {
        decoded.data.push({
            type: "error",
            Value: -1
        });

        return { data: decoded }
    }

    const arrayBuffer = new ArrayBuffer(4);
    const dataView = new DataView(arrayBuffer);
    
    for(let j =0 ; j < input.bytes.length; j+=5) {
        var num =0;
        switch ( input.bytes[j]) {
            case 0:
                type = 'Temp';
                num  = 2;
                break;
            case 1:
                type = 'Humidity';
                num  = 2;
                break;
            case 2:
                type = 'CO2';
                num  = 0;
                break;
            case 3:
                type = 'TVOC';
                num  = 0;
                break;
            case 4:
                type = 'Light';
                num  = 0;
                break;
            default:
                type = 'unknown';
                break;
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            dataView.setUint8(i, input.bytes[j+i+1]);
        }
        floatNumber = dataView.getFloat32(0, true); 
        decoded.data.push({
            type:  type,
            Value: floatNumber.toFixed(num)
        });
    }
    return { data: decoded }
}

function encodeDownlink(input) {
  return {
    bytes: [225, 230, 255, 0]
  };
}
```

## Step 4 **Sending and Receiving Messages** {#uplink_and_downlink}

In this section, we will walk you through the process of monitoring both uplink and downlink communications between your device and the LoRaWAN network.[^4]

[^4]: [In-Depth: Sending and Receiving Messages with LoRaWAN®](https://lora-developers.semtech.com/documentation/tech-papers-and-guides/sending-and-receiving-messages-with-lorawan/sending-and-receiving-messages/)

### Uplink Message

Uplink messages are fundamental in a LoRaWAN network, enabling devices like the SenseCAP Indicator to transmit data to a network server. These messages are crucial for reporting *sensor data*, device status, and other telemetry information.

<details>

<summary>The Concept of Uplink Message</summary>

**Uplink in LoRaWAN:**

In a LoRaWAN network, an uplink message is any communication initiated by an end device (like the SenseCAP Indicator) and sent to the network server through a gateway. These messages are typically used for transmitting sensor readings or device status.

1. **Data Collection**: The SenseCAP Indicator collects data from its sensors or internal processes. This could include environmental readings, device status, or other relevant metrics.

2. **Data Packaging**: The collected data is then packaged into a *predefined format* suitable for transmission. This may involve encoding the data to optimize payload size and ensure efficient transmission.

3. **Sending the Message**: The device transmits the uplink message through the LoRaWAN network. This transmission is usually scheduled based on specific intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) or triggered by certain events (e.g., a threshold breach).

**Receiving and Processing at the Network Server:**

Once the uplink message is sent by the SenseCAP Indicator, it is received by the LoRaWAN network server via a gateway. The network server then processes the message as follows:

1. **Message Reception**: The network server receives the uplink message from the gateway and decodes it.

2. **Data Processing and Analysis**: After decoding, the server processes the data, which might involve logging it, triggering alerts, or performing further analysis. The data can include various types of information such as temperature readings, humidity levels, or other sensor data, depending on the capabilities of the device.

3. **Response Actions**: Based on the received data, the network server may take action, such as sending a downlink message to the device with instructions or updates. This response can be automated based on predefined rules or triggered manually by a user monitoring the system.

In the context of the LoRaWAN demo using the SenseCAP Indicator, the uplink message might consist of simple sensor data, like temperature or humidity readings. 

Once the *join process* is successful, you can view the logs in the `LoRaWAN frames` section to monitor the data transmission and receive a detailed account of the device's communication with the network.

:::tip
Navigate to the *LoRaWAN frames* section of a device within the application you've created, and locate your specific device. This is where you can monitor and manage the data packets being transmitted and received by your device, ensuring smooth communication and operation within the LoRaWAN network.

### Downlink Message

The downlink process in the LoRaWAN network is critical for bi-directional communication, allowing the transmission of data and commands from the network server back to the SenseCAP Indicator device. This capability is particularly useful for various operational commands, configuration changes, or firmware updates.

<details>

<summary>The Concept of Downlink Message</summary>

**Downlink in LoRaWAN:**

In the LoRaWAN demo environment, downlink messages are used to control an animated bulb on the SenseCAP Indicator, allowing users to switch it on or off. However, this functionality can be extended to execute specific commands or configurations as needed.

**Sending a Downlink Message**

1. **Initiating a Downlink Message**: To send a downlink message, you will typically use the network server’s interface. Navigate to the section where you can schedule downlink messages for your device.

2. **Message Format**: Ensure that the message is formatted according to the specifications required by the SenseCAP Indicator. This could include specific payload formats or encoding methods, depending on what the downlink message is intended to do.

3. **Scheduling the Message**: After composing the message, schedule it to be sent at an appropriate time. The timing may depend on various factors, such as the device’s data transmission schedule or its expected time of activity.

**Receiving and Processing the Downlink Message on the Device**

Once a downlink message is transmitted by the LoRaWAN network server, the SenseCAP Indicator will receive it during its next receive window. The device processes the message as follows:

1. **Message Reception**: The SenseCAP Indicator listens for downlink messages during predefined receive windows. It is crucial that the device is in a receptive state during these periods.

2. **Processing the Message**: Upon receiving a downlink message, the device will process the contents. This could involve changing a setting, updating a parameter, or triggering an action like toggling a relay or adjusting a sensor threshold[^5].

#### Demo Message: Controlling a Bulb

In this demonstration, we'll illustrate how downlink messages can be used to control a simulated bulb on the Indicator within via the LoRaWAN network. This example showcases the practical application of downlink communication for remote device management.

**1. Scenario Overview:**

- In this demo, the SenseCAP Indicator is configured with a virtual bulb, which represents a simple, controllable device.
- The bulb has two states: 'on' and 'off', which are controlled via downlink messages sent from the LoRaWAN network server.

**2. Preparing the Downlink Message:**

- To control the bulb, a specific payload structure is defined for the downlink message. For simplicity, let's assume:
  - Sending the payload `0001` turns the bulb on.
  - Sending the payload `0000` turns the bulb off.

 - These payloads are encoded in a format that the SenseCAP Indicator is programmed to understand and act upon.[^6]

</div>

**3. Sending the Downlink Message:**

 - Through the network server's interface, you can schedule the downlink message with the corresponding payload.
 - The message is then queued and sent to the SenseCAP Indicator during its next available receive window(so there is delay).

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={480} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/queue_packet.png"/>
</div>

**4. Receiving the Downlink Message:**

For turning the bulb on, you schedule a downlink with payload `0001`. To turn it off, you use payload `0000`. As I had enqueued a downlink message `0001`, now I want to send a downlink message `0000` to turn the bulb off.

<div align="center">
  <img class='border-radius: 10px;' width={480} src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/LoRaWAN_Application/console_bulb.png"/>
</div>

And you can see that the bulb is **turned off**.

<details>
<summary>Why is the True Network Server not sending a joinAccept?</summary>

**Note:** There are a few scenarios where a device may fail to receive a `joinAccept` from the network server:

- **Frequency Change:** If you alter the frequency settings but retain the same device credentials on the network server, the device may not synchronize properly.

- **Device Flash Cleaned:** If you've cleared the device's flash memory but continue using the same credentials, this can lead to synchronization issues.

In both cases, it's crucial to ensure that the OTAA (Over-the-Air Activation) device nonces (number used once) are in sync. To address this, use the `Flush OTAA device nonces` feature on your network server. This action will reset the nonces and help re-establish a proper connection.
