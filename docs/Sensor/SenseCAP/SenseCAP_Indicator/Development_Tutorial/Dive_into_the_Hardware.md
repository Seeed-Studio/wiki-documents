# **Overview**

The SenseCAP Indicator is a 4-inch touch screen device that is powered by the ESP32 and RP2040 dual MCUs. ESP32 and RP2040 are both highly capable microcontrollers that offer a range of features and functions.

This chapter will provide detailed information about ESP32 and RP2040 of SenseCAP Indicator, including their functions and usage. It covers include programming, interfacing with sensors, and communicating with other devices，etc.

As shown in the figure, the SenseCAP Indicator is primarily driven by the ESP32 and RP2040 MCUs, which are connected to the LoRa transceiver, LCD, and other peripheral circuits.
In the following sections, we will provide an overview of the ESP32 and RP2040 development and their respective capabilities.

## **ESP32-S3**

ESP32-S3 is a highly integrated system-on-chip (SoC) that combines a powerful CPU, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 5.0 capabilities, also includes a range of input/output pins and interfaces, such as UART, SPI, I2C, and PWM, which allow it to interface with other devices and sensors.



## **RP2040**

SenseCAP Indicator is embeded with [RP2040](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-p-4832.html?), RP2040 features a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor with clock speeds up to 133 MHz, 264KB of RAM, and a range of peripherals such as USB, UART, SPI, and I2C. It also includes a unique feature called Programmable I/O (PIO), which allows users to implement custom digital interfaces without the need for specialized hardware.

## **ESP32-S3 and RP2040 Communication**

ESP32 and RP2040 use serial port communication, using the [COBS](http://www.stuartcheshire.org/papers/COBSforToN.pdf) communication protocol.

In the terminal demo, the following data frames are used for transmission：

| Byte0    | Byte1-4          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| PKT_TYPE | PKT_PARA (Little Endia)  |
