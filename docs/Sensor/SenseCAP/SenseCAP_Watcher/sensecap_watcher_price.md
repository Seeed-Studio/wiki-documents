# SenseCraft AI for Watcher Plans and Benefits

At Watcher, we believe in providing developers with a clear and transparent pricing structure for integrating artificial intelligence into their projects. We understand that every developer has unique requirements, which is why we offer a range of pricing plans designed to cater to various needs and budgets. To help you make an informed decision, we've outlined the key aspects of our pricing model and the specific features included in each plan.

## Understanding Our Pricing Model

### Data Storage

All plans come with a generous **3-month** data storage, which includes the storage of alarm images, timestamps, and alarm counts.

### Task Analysis

Task Analysis refers to Watcher's ability to understand and interpret user-assigned tasks, breaking them down into smaller, actionable components. This includes determining whether a task can be executed using small models, identifying the specific models to be used, recognizing the behaviors to be detected, and defining the actions to be taken. As the foundation of Watcher's functionality, we strive to keep Task Analysis free of charge across all plans.

### Image Analysis

Image Analysis involves the advanced examination of images captured by Watcher, enabling the identification of objects, activities, and contexts within the images. This feature requires the use of large models and is subject to usage fees. A request is counted when your task requires the use of a large model for image analysis.

- If you're using the **[Pure Cloud-based LLM Service](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/getting_started_with_watcher_task/#pure-cloud-based-llm-service)**, requests are counted based on your set **Capture Frequency**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/watcher_getting_started/llm-app.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

- For the **[Local AI + Cloud-based LLM Service](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/getting_started_with_watcher_task/#local-ai--cloud-based-llm-service)**, a request is counted when the large model is invoked for image recognition after the small model triggers a detection. Please note that the minimum interval between requests will not be shorter than your configured **Capture Frequency**.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/watcher_getting_started/local_llm-app.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Image analysis is also one of the very important capabilities of Watcher. So when you don't have a subscription to SenseCraft Pro, we also guarantee at least a 15-minute image analysis service for you to use.

### Chat with Large Language Model

Engaging in conversational interactions with our powerful Large Language Model is a premium feature that incurs usage fees. When SenseCraft determines that your conversation with Watcher is a back-and-forth exchange and Watcher generates a response, it is counted as a single request.

Once this count runs out, it is not possible to chat with Watcher.

### Model Repository, Training, and Upload

Access to our extensive [Model Repository](https://sensecraft.seeed.cc/ai/#/model?redirect=%2Fdevice), as well as the ability to train and upload your own models, is provided free of charge across all plans.
