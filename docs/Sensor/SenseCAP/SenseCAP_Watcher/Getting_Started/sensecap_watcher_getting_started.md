Please note that due to the time constraints of the task flow, **there will be a minimum interval between consecutive alerts to avoid excessive notifications**.
:::

By following these steps, you can effectively send commands to your Watcher using the SenseCraft APP, enabling it to perform specific monitoring tasks and notify you when the specified conditions are met.

Remember to regularly review and adjust your Watcher's settings and task flows to ensure optimal performance and alignment with your monitoring requirements. For a more detailed description and explanation of the APP's tasks and options, as well as a detailed description of the intervals, please read **[Watcher Quick Start Series 1# : Concepts and Classification of Tasks](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/getting_started_with_watcher_task/)** to learn more.

The Watcher offers a convenient and intuitive way to send tasks or engage in conversation using voice commands, thanks to its "Push to Talk" feature. This functionality is accessible from any screen or interface on the device, making it easy to interact with the Watcher without navigating through menus. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use this feature:

1. Activate Push to Talk:

   - Locate the Wheel Button on the top-right corner of the Watcher.
   - Press and hold the Wheel Button to enter the voice input interface.

2. Speak Your Command or Message:

   - While holding the Wheel Button, clearly speak your task or message to the Watcher.
   - You can assign tasks, such as "Tell me if the baby is crying" or "If the dog is stealing food, say stop copper".
   - Alternatively, you can engage in conversation by asking questions or making statements, like "Tell me a joke".

3. Release the Wheel Button:

   - Once you have finished speaking, release the Wheel Button.
   - The Watcher will process your voice input and determine whether it is a task assignment or a conversation.

4. Task Assignment:

   - If the Watcher recognizes your voice input as a task assignment, it will automatically break down your task into relevant components.
   - The Watcher will display cards on its screen, showing the **Object** (what to monitor), **Behavior** (what action to look for), **Notification** (how to alert you), **Time Range** (when to monitor), and **Frequency** (how often to monitor).
   - Review the displayed information to ensure it accurately represents your intended task.
   - If the details are correct, confirm the task, and the Watcher will begin executing it according to the specified parameters.

5. Conversation:

   - If the Watcher determines that you are engaging in conversation, it will respond to your queries or statements using both the screen and voice output.
   - The Watcher will display its response on the screen while simultaneously speaking it out loud.
   - After each conversation turn, there will be a brief buffer period.
   - If you press and hold the Wheel Button and speak again within this buffer period, you can continue the conversation seamlessly.
   - However, if you do not speak within the buffer period, the Watcher will consider the conversation ended and return to its previous state.

Tips for Optimal Usage:

- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace to ensure accurate voice recognition.
- When speaking, please get as close to Watcher as possible, about **3 ~ 10cm** distance speaking recognition accuracy is best.
- Minimize background noise to improve the Watcher's ability to understand your voice commands.
- Be specific and concise when assigning tasks to help the Watcher accurately interpret your intentions.
- If the Watcher misinterprets your task or conversation, simply press and hold the Wheel Button again to provide clarification or corrections.

By leveraging the Push to Talk feature, you can effortlessly send tasks and engage in conversations with the Watcher, making your interaction with the device more natural and efficient.

:::note
If you encounter an error of **0x7002**, it means that the current Watcher's network status is not good and the audio service call failed, please change the network or location and retry again.

   - The RGB Light setting is a toggle switch that allows you to turn the LED indicator light on or off.

   - This information can be helpful when troubleshooting issues or checking for available updates.

- **Shutdown/Reboot**:
   - The Shutdown/Reboot setting allows you to restart or power off your Watcher device, depending on the power source.
