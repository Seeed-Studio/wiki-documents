## Device Functions

### Work Mode

To apply to different scenarios, there are several different working modes on the SenseCAP T1000 tracker, which you can choose according to your needs.

|**Work Mode**|**Description**|**Scene**|
| - | - | - |
|Standby Mode|<p>Only heartbeat packets are uploaded, just includes battery info. </p><p>The location can be obtained using the LoRa downlink command.</p>|If you need to locate the device for a long time and the device can run for a long time before being charged, the cloud platform can issue a location request command to locate the device.|
|Periodic Mode|Set an interval at which the device periodically uploads location and sensor data.|This mode is recommended for most scenarios.|
|Event Mode|Adjust the upload interval according to the temperature, light and acceleration sensor of the tracker, including temperature event, light event, motion event, motionless timeout, and shock event.|It can be used in complex scenarios, such as monitoring the transportation of important items. But the power consumption increases a lot.|



### Sensor Function

The SenseCAP T1000 Tracker is equipped with 3 sensors: Temperature sensor, Light sensor and 3-Axis Accelerometer.
You can choose enable or disable these sensors:

* Turn off all sensors, but you can also choose a version without sensor to reduce costs.
* Only the temperature and light sensors are enabled to monitor data periodically with low power consumption.
* When temperature, illumination and accelerometer are used as trigger conditions, the sensor will always be powered, and the device consumes a lot of power.


|**Sensor**|**Description**|
| - | - |
|Temperature|<p>This is an onboard independent temperature sensor with **an accuracy of ±0.5~1℃**. It should be noted that there may be some temperature measurement delay here, because it is separated from the shell.</p><p>Range: -20 to 60℃; Accuracy: ± 1℃(min 0.5℃, max 1℃); Resolution: 0.1℃</p>|
|Light|<p>The light sensor is not the actual lumen value monitored, but a percentage of the light from dark to amount. Mainly can be used for anti-demolition monitoring and some light sensitive monitoring.</p><p>Range: 0 to 100%, (0% is dark, 100% is brightest)</p>|
|3-Axis Accelerometer|By setting the value of acceleration, motion event and shock event are triggered.|

### Data Cache

The device can cache data, which can be enabled through Bluetooth configuration by opening "GNSS Data Cache". The device uploads confirmation packets. When the LoRaWAN signal coverage is weak or there is no network coverage, the device cannot receive an ack when uploading data. In this case, the data will be saved and entered the next cycle. When the device successfully uploads data at some point, it will send offline data. The maximum number of data that can be cached is 1000 records.

:::info Note
* It's recommended to power off the device if it's not in use.
* When first turned on, it is recommended to test it outdoors, as the GPS needs to update the time via satellite.
* Please make sure the frequency band matches your gateway frequency.

The sensor supports two network access modes, OTAA by default.

|**Parameter**|**Description**|
| - | - |
|OTAA (default)|Over The Air Activation, it joins the network through Device EUI, App EUI, and App Key.|
|ABP|Activation By Personalization, it joins the network through DevAddr, NwkSkey, and AppSkey.|

The device uses OTAA to join the LoRaWAN network by default. So, it can set the device EUI, App EUI and App Key.

|**Parameter**|**Type**|
| - | - |
|Device EUI|<a name="ole_link10"></a>16, hexadecimal from 0 ~ F|
|App EUI|16, hexadecimal from 0 ~ F|
|App Key|32, hexadecimal from 0 ~ F|

:::info Note
When using the SenseCAP platform, the EUI, APP EUI and APP Key are fixed and are the same as the sensor label.<br />
When the sensor is selected to be used with a public platform such as Helium or TTN, the EUI will not change, and the sensor will generate a new fixed App EUI and App Key for network access.<br />
To obtain EUI information in batches, please contact our sales team.

#### Geolocation Mode Setup

The tracker supports positioning via GNSS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

- **GNSS**: The longitude and latitude can be directly obtained through GPS and other satellite positioning, then upload data via LoRa.
- **Wi-Fi**: Passive scanning, uploads the scanned 4 MAC addresses via LoRa. 
- **BLE**: Uploads the scanned 3 best signal MAC addresses of Beacon via LoRa.
