## Product Description

SenseCAP LoRaWAN® S2107 temperature Sensor measures temperature at the range of -50°C~300°C. A highly accurate temperature sensor PT1000 that can support temperature detection in wide temperature ranges and industrial scenarios. 
Pt1000 sensors (1000 ohm temperature sensors) are the most common type of platinum resistance thermometer. The S2107 supports a three-wire circuit for PT1000 sensors and allows for the connection of up to three sensors simultaneously.
Direct contact temperature is an important indicator in many scenarios, especially in liquid detection, food monitoring, storage cold chain, industrial boilers, aquaculture solutions. The S2107 is specifically optimized for OTA with built-in Bluetooth, which enables quick setup and update. Benefiting from LoRa and IP66 design, this sensor features stability and reliability and can cover a long transmission range while keeping lower power consumption. Unlike wireline devices, it is battery-powered, reducing the workload and complexity of the deployment, and can be disassembled and installed in a few minutes.
