## Device Installation

**Step 1:** Select an Appropriate Installation Location

Before installing the weather station, please consider the followings:

**(1)**Rain gauge must be cleaned every few months.

**(2)**Avoid radiant heat reflected from any adjacent buildings and structures. Ideally, the weather station should be installed at 1.5m (5') from any building, structure, ground, or rooftop.

**(3)**Choose an area of open space in direct sunlight without any obstruction of rain, wind, and sunlight.

**(4)**Transmission range between the weather station and the gateway could reach a distance of 2~10 km at the line of sight, providing there are no interfering obstacles in between or nearby such as trees, towers, or high voltage lines. Check the reception signal quality to ensure good reception.

**(5)**Household appliances such as fridges, lighting, and dimmers may pose Electro-magnetic interference (EMI), while Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from devices operating in the same frequency range may cause signal intermittently. Choose a location at least 1-2 meters (3-5 feet) away from these interference sources to ensure the best reception.

**Step 2:** Installing the Weather Station

**(1)**Adjust the solar panel

The tilting angle of the solar panel can be adjusted vertically from 0° to 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60°positions depending on the area you are living in. For optimal power output year-round, please set the tilt angle that is closest to your latitude.

:::info Note
Any metal object can attract lightning strikes, including the mounting pole. Never install a weather station on stormy days.
If you want to install a weather station on a house or building,consult a licensed electrical engineer to ensure proper grounding.Direct lightning impact on a metal pole can damage or destroy your home.

Installing the sensor at a high location may result in personal injury or death.Perform as many initial inspections and operations as possible on the ground and in buildings or houses. Only install the weather station on clear, dry days.
:::

**Step 4:** Direction Alignment

Install the weather station in an open location with no obstructions above and around the sensor for accurate rain and wind measurement.

Locate the North (N) marker on top of the weather station and align the marker to point North upon final installation with a compass or GPS. Tighten the mounting bracket around a 30 to 40 mm diameter pole (not included) using two screws and nuts provided.

Use the bubble level on the weather station to make sure the sensor is completely level for proper measurement of rainfall, UV, and light intensity.

>- Installation direction. When installing equipment, in addition to the direction of wind direction, also needs to consider the direction of wireless transmission. In the direction shown, pointing to the gateway will get a better signal.

>
>- Distance. Path loss occurs naturally with distance. This device is rated to 10km by a line of sight (in an interference-free environment and without barriers). However, typically you will get 1~3km maximum in a real-life installation, which includes passing through barriers.
>
>-  Barriers. Radio signals are blocked by metal barriers such as aluminum cladding. Please align the weather station and gateway to get them in a clear line of sight through the window if you have metal cladding.
>
> The table below shows a typical level of reduction in signal strength each time the signal passed through these building materials (RF signal reduction for reference):

## Trouble Shooting 
### Maintenance of Weather Station

### Sensors can't join the LoRa network, how to do?

1. Check the gateway frequency configuration. Make sure the gateway and Sensors have the same uplink and downlink frequency.

2. Check the real-time log and click the config button of the sensor to see if there are any sensor data packets. If there are packets, check whether the gateway is sending downlink packets.

3. If the channels and other configurations are correct and the gateway logs do not have packets, please contact technical support.
