## Sensors can't join the LoRa network, how to do?

1)  Check the gateway frequency configuration. Make sure the gateway and Sensors have the same uplink and downlink frequency.

2)  Check the real-time log and click the config button of the sensor to see if there are any sensor data packets. If there are packets, check whether the gateway is sending downlink packets.

3)  If the channels and other configurations are correct and the gateway logs do not have packets, please contact technical support.
