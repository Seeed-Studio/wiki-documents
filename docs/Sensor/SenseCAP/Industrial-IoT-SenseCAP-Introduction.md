###### _(Industrial IoT Products Application Scenarios)_

Since 2018, we have been putting the accumulated resources, experience, and expertise into creating IIoT products for various environmental monitoring occasions. And we’ve spent months on putting the products into field tests in different countries and regions before making them generally available.

Currently, the SenseCAP IIoT collection consists of [SenseCAP LoRaWAN Series gateways & sensors](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-c-1339.html), [Sensor Hub 2G/4G Data Logger](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/product/sensor-hub-2g-data-logger/) & [RS-485 sensors](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Industrial-IoT-c-1556.html?cat=1581), and [Meteorological Sensors](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/new-release-sensecap-one-industrial-grade-compact-weather-stations-for-meteorological-monitoring/). Other than hardware, we also provide software & Cloud services including SenseCAP API, SenseCAP APP, SenseCAP Portal, and SenseCAP Dashboard for easily managing the devices and data. Please see more details below.

## Hardware Products

All Seeed IIoT hardware products are designed with industry standards, IP66 rated, and encapsulated in UV-resistant materials to ensure great robustness. They are suitable to be deployed in outdoor scenarios with severe conditions.

### LoRaWAN Series

![SenseCAP LoRaWAN Gateway & Sensors deployed in the Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge](https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/102991154/wiki%20images/sensecap%20application%201.png)

###### _(SenseCAP LoRaWAN Gateway & Sensors deployed in the Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge)_

LoRaWAN series comprise sensors and gateways which support LoRaWAN protocol and are LoRaWAN certified. These products are suitable for applications that need the wireless transmission of data across ultra-wide distance – 9.6 km in line of sight scene and 2 km in urban scenes, [according to our testing](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/how-we-tested-the-long-range-communication-of-seeeds-industrial-iot-product-sensecap-lorawan-series/). As well, the low power consumption features support a battery lifespan of an average of 3 years, some sensor nodes can last more than 8 years depending on the sensors’ power consumption.

![SenseCAP LoRaWAN system architecture](https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/102991154/wiki%20images/SenseCAP%20LoRaWAN%20Architecture.png)

###### _(SenseCAP LoRaWAN system architecture)_

SenseCAP LoRaWAN sensors include those measuring [CO2](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/product/sensecap-lorawan-co2-sensor/), [Light](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/product/sensecap-lorawan-light-intensity-sensor/), [soil TH](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/product/sensecap-wireless-soil-moisture-and-temperature-sensor-lorawan/), [air TH](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/product/sensecap-lorawan-air-temperature-and-humidity-sensor/), [air pressure](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/product/sensecap-lorawan-barometric-pressure-sensor/), and so on. [SenseCAP LoRaWAN gateway](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/product/sensecap-gateway-lorawan/) is carrier-grade and has the capacity of working with up to 1000 sensors simultaneously. It’s suitable for the needs of gathering data in multiple locations such as soil moisture and temperature at different locations of the farm. In this case, you only need one gateway, and easily deploy several sensors across the farm. The deployment instruction is easy to follow, and it would only take you [a few minutes to set up](https://blog.seeedstudio.com/blog/2020/07/23/4-steps-to-deploy-iot-devices-sensecap-lorawan/).

### Sensor Hub 2G/4G Data Logger

![SenseCAP Sensor Hub with some collections of RS-485 Sensors](https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/102991154/wiki%20images/Sensor-Hub-2-1030x736.png)

###### _(SenseCAP Sensor Hub with some collections of RS-485 Sensors)_

[SenseCAP Sensor Hub](https://solution.seeedstudio.com/product/sensor-hub-2g-data-logger/) is an easy-to-use, low-cost yet powerful data logger. As the system architecture is shown above, it comes with multiple RS-485 connectors and can be connected to a maximum of 40 RS-485 sensors. It is able to transmit data obtained by sensors to the server via 2G/3G/4G. It’s suitable for the needs of gathering multiple data at one location. For example, the air temperature, air humidity, and barometric pressure, etc. data is the same across a large outdoor field, the user only needs to deploy a Sensor Hub Data Logger with all the Sensors at one location to monitor the info across the whole area.

![SenseCAP Sensor Hub System Architecture](https://files.seeedstudio.com/products/102991154/wiki%20images/sensor%20hub%20architecture%20.png)

###### _(SenseCAP Sensor Hub System Architecture)_

SenseCAP Sensor Hub can be powered by solar power, wall power, or rechargeable batteries. With the multiple options for power source, Sensor Hub can work with sensors of higher power consumption such as ammonia. It can also meet the needs of more frequent data upload intervals. You can actually combine SenseCAP LoRaWAN with SenseCAP Sensor Hub + RS485 sensors into your projects to meet various needs of monitoring different environmental data.
