Extract the archive and place it in your Arduino libraries folder. Open Arduino IDE and choose Examples-> name of your project Inferencing Edge Impulse - > nano_ble33_sense_accelerometer sketch. Our board is similar to Arduino Nano BLE33 Sense, but uses different accelerometer (LIS3DHTR instead of LSM9DS1), so we will need to change the data acquisition section accordingly. Also, since Wio Terminal has an LCD screen, we're going to display name of the detected class if this class confidence value is above threshold.\nFirst change the header"),(0,i.yg)("pre",null,(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},"#include <Arduino_LSM9DS1.h>\n")),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"to"),(0,i.yg)("pre",null,(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},'#include"LIS3DHTR.h"\n#include"TFT_eSPI.h"\nLIS3DHTR<TwoWire> lis;\nTFT_eSPI tft;\n')),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Then change initialization in setup function"),(0,i.yg)("pre",null,(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},'    if (!IMU.begin()) {\n        ei_printf("Failed to initialize IMU!\\r\\n");\n    }\n    else {\n        ei_printf("IMU initialized\\r\\n");\n    }\n')),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"to"),(0,i.yg)("pre",null,(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},'    tft.begin();\n    tft.setRotation(3);\n    tft.fillScreen(TFT_WHITE);\n\n lis.begin(Wire1);\n    \n    if (!lis.available()) {\n    Serial.println("Failed to initialize IMU!");\n    while (1);\n    }\n    else {\n        ei_printf("IMU initialized\\r\\n");\n    }\n    lis.setOutputDataRate(LIS3DHTR_DATARATE_100HZ); // Setting output data rage to 25Hz, can be set up tp 5kHz \n    lis.setFullScaleRange(LIS3DHTR_RANGE_16G); // Setting scale range to 2g, select from 2,4,8,16g\n')),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"We do data collection and inference within loop function, here is where we need to change data acquisition with LSM9DS1 to data acquisition function for LIS3DHTR"),(0,i.yg)("pre",null,(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},"IMU.readAcceleration(buffer[ix], buffer[ix + 1], buffer[ix + 2]);\n")),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"to"),(0,i.yg)("pre",null,(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},"lis.getAcceleration(&buffer[ix], &buffer[ix + 1], &buffer[ix + 2]);\n")),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"And then to display the class name on the LCD screen, after"),(0,i.yg)("pre",null,(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},'#if EI_CLASSIFIER_HAS_ANOMALY == 1\n    ei_printf("    anomaly score: %.3f\\n", result.anomaly);\n#endif\n')),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"add the following code block, in which we check confidence values of every class and if one of them is higher than threshold, change the color of the screen and display that classes name."),(0,i.yg)("pre",null,(0,i.yg)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-cpp"},'   if (result.classification[1].value > 0.7) {\n    tft.fillScreen(TFT_PURPLE);\n    tft.setFreeFont(&FreeSansBoldOblique12pt7b);\n    tft.drawString("Wave", 20, 80);\n    delay(1000);\n    tft.fillScreen(TFT_WHITE);\n   }\n   \n   if (result.classification[2].value > 0.7) {\n    tft.fillScreen(TFT_RED);\n    tft.setFreeFont(&FreeSansBoldOblique12pt7b);\n    tft.drawString("Circle", 20, 80);\n    delay(1000);\n    tft.fillScreen(TFT_WHITE);\n   }\n')),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Then compile and upload - open the serial monitor and perform one the gestures!
