If it is one relatively long time \u2013  then it  is rock (fist passing above the sensors). If it is two times,  then it  is scissors. Anything more than that is paper.

Both Flatten and Spectral Features   processing blocks remove the time relationship within each window \u2013   Flatten block simply turns the raw values, that are initially in sequence to Average, Min, Max, etc. values calculated on all values in time window, irrespective of their order. Spectral Features block extracts the frequency and power  characteristics and the reason it didn\u2019t work that well for this particular task is probably, that the duration of each gesture is too short. So, the way to achieve best performance is to use Raw data block, which will preserve the time series data.
