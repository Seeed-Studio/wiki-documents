# Quickstart Guide

Follow this guide to get your Reachy Mini up and running, either on real hardware or in simulation.

## 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed Reachy Mini on your computer following our [installation guide](/reachymini_sdk_installation).

:::tip
Ensure you have created and activated your Python virtual environment. **Remember to activate it every time you open a new terminal!**
:::

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Run SDK directly on Wireless Reachy Mini (Optional)</strong></summary>

If you want to run the SDK directly on your wireless Reachy Mini instead of remotely on your computer, you can connect via SSH into it.

### Step 1: SSH Connection

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
ssh pollen@reachy-mini
```

When prompted, use these **default credentials**:
- Username: `pollen`
- Password: `root`

### Step 2: Activate the Python virtual environment

After connecting, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source /venvs/apps_venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Run scripts locally

When running scripts on Reachy Mini itself, use the standard `ReachyMini()` constructor. Auto mode will keep the connection on localhost unless you explicitly override it:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    # Your code here
```

:::tip
Benefits of running locally
Lower latency, no network dependency, and direct access to all robot resources.
:::
:::warning
Drawbacks
Lower CPU power, and no GUI available.
:::

## 2. Ensure the Robot Server is running (Daemon)

The **Daemon** is a background service that handles the low-level communication with motors and sensors. It must be running for your code to work.

* **On Reachy Mini (Wireless)**: The daemon is running when the robot is powered on. Ensure your computer and Reachy Mini are on the same network.
* **On Reachy Mini Lite (USB)** - You have two options :
  - Start the [desktop application](/reachymini_platforms_reachy_mini_lite_get_started#3--download-reachy-mini-control)
  - Open a terminal and run :
    ```bash
    reachy-mini-daemon
    ```
* **For Simulation (No robot needed)** - You have two options :
  - Start the [desktop application](/reachymini_platforms_reachy_mini_lite_get_started#3--download-reachy-mini-control)
  - Open a terminal and run:
    - **Linux & Windows:**
      ```bash
      reachy-mini-daemon --sim
      ```
    - **macOS:**
      ```bash
      mjpython -m reachy_mini.daemon.app.main --sim
      ```
      > **⚠️ macOS Users:** `uv` may have compatibility issues with MuJoCo on macOS. If you encounter installation or runtime problems, it's recommended to use `pip` directly instead of `uv` for MuJoCo-related packages.
      >
      > If you get a segmentation fault from `libgstpython`, see the [simulation troubleshooting](/reachymini_platforms_simulation_get_started#-troubleshooting) section.

Open [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your browser. If you see the Reachy SDK API documentation, you are ready!

## 3. Your First Script

:::warning
Keep the daemon terminal open and running! The daemon must stay active for your robot to work.
:::

### Create your Python script

**Step 1:** Open a new terminal window

**Step 2:** Create a new file called `hello.py` and copy-paste the following code into it:

:::tip
The constructor now auto-detects Lite vs Wireless and switches between localhost and network automatically. Only override it for advanced cases, e.g. `ReachyMini(connection_mode="network")`.
:::

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

# Connect to the running daemon
with ReachyMini() as mini:
    print("Connected to Reachy Mini! ")

    # Wiggle antennas
    print("Wiggling antennas...")
    mini.goto_target(antennas=[0.5, -0.5], duration=0.5)
    mini.goto_target(antennas=[-0.5, 0.5], duration=0.5)
    mini.goto_target(antennas=[0, 0], duration=0.5)

    print("Done!")
```

**Step 3:** Save the file and run your script:

In your new terminal, run:

```bash
python hello.py
```

🎉 If everything went well, your robot should now wiggle its antennas!

## Using an AI Coding Agent?

If you're using an AI agent like **Claude Code**, **Codex**, or **Copilot**, you can start building apps right away. Just paste this prompt:

> *I'd like to create a Reachy Mini app. Start by reading https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/blob/main/AGENTS.md*

This guide gives your AI agent everything it needs to know about the SDK, best practices, and available tools.

## Next Steps
