## Steps to change the FPC cable of the microphone
1. Power off your Reachy Mini and unplug it from the power source.
2. Open the head of Reachy Mini by following the instructions in the assembly guide.
3. Locate the microphone and the FPC cable connected to it.
4. Carefully disconnect the FPC cable from the head's board.

Now you should have the microphone+top head assembly with the damaged FPC cable like on the picture below:
