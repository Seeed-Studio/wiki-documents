# Reachy Mini Development Guide for AI Agents

This guide helps AI agents assist users in developing Reachy Mini applications.

---

## Agent Behavior

### FIRST: Check for agents.local.md

**Before doing anything else**, search for `agents.local.md` in the current directory:

```
IF agents.local.md exists:
    Read it immediately
    It contains user configuration and session context
ELSE:
    → Run skills/setup-environment.md to set up the environment
```

This file stores the user's robot type, preferences, and setup status. Always check it first.

### Be a Teacher

Unless the user explicitly requests otherwise:
- Explain concepts as you go
- Encourage questions ("Let me know if you'd like more detail on any of this")
- Guide non-technical users through each step
- Don't assume prior knowledge

### Always Create Python Apps

When creating apps:
- **Always use Python** - Python apps are discoverable and shareable via the robot's app store
- **NEVER create app folders manually** - always use the app assistant (handles metadata, entry points, structure)
- **If the command fails** - ask the user to run it in their terminal; don't attempt complex workarounds
- **Web UIs go in `static/`** - Python apps can have web frontends

```bash
# Default template (minimal app - good for most cases):
reachy-mini-app-assistant create <app_name> <path> --publish

# Conversation template (for LLM integration, speech, making robot talk):
reachy-mini-app-assistant create --template conversation <app_name> <path> --publish
```

See `skills/create-app.md` for details. JS-only apps are not yet supported for discovery/sharing.

### Always Create plan.md Before Coding

Before implementing any app:
1. Create `plan.md` in the app directory
2. Write your understanding of what the user wants
3. List your technical approach
4. Ask clarifying questions and provide answer fields inside `plan.md`
5. Wait for answers before coding

### Keep Notes in agents.local.md

Use `agents.local.md` to store:
- User's robot type (Lite/Wireless)
- Environment preferences
- Useful context for future sessions
- Keep it concise

## Robot Basics

**Reachy Mini** is a small expressive robot:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Head** | 6 DOF: x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw (via Stewart platform) |
| **Body** | Rotation around vertical axis |
| **Antennas** | 2 motors, also usable as physical buttons |

**Hardware variants:**
- **Lite**: USB connection to laptop (full compute power)
- **Wireless**: Onboard CM4, connects via WiFi (limited compute)

---

## SDK Essentials

### Connection

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    # Your code here
```

### Two Motion Methods

| Method | Use when |
|--------|----------|
| `goto_target()` | **Default** - smooth interpolation for gestures that last at least 0.5s each |
| `set_target()` | Real-time control loops (e.g. tracking) at 10Hz+ |

### Basic Example

See and run `examples/minimal_demo.py` - demonstrates connection, head motion, and antenna control.

### Before Writing Code

- Read `docs/source/SDK/python-sdk.md` for API overview
- Skim `src/reachy_mini/reachy_mini.py` for method signatures and docstrings
- Check `examples/` for runnable code patterns

---

## REST API

The daemon exposes an HTTP/WebSocket API at `http://{daemon-ip}:8000/api`.

- **Lite**: `localhost:8000` (daemon runs on your machine)
- **Wireless**: `reachy-mini.local:8000` or the robot's IP address

**Use REST API for:** Web UIs, non-Python clients, remote control, AI/LLM integration via HTTP. => Note: for the app to be discoverable, it must be a python app for now, this will change in a future release.

**Interactive docs:** `http://{daemon-ip}:8000/docs` (when daemon is running)

See `skills/rest-api.md` for details.

## Platform Compatibility

| Setup | Compute | Camera | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Lite** | Full (laptop) | Direct USB | Most flexible, best for dev |
| **Wireless (local)** | Limited (CM4) | Direct | Memory/CPU constrained |
| **Wireless (streamed)** | Full (laptop) | Via network | Some tracking quality loss |
| **Simulation** | Full | N/A | Can't test camera features |

---

## Safety Limits

| Joint | Range |
|-------|-------|
| Head pitch/roll | [-40, +40] degrees |
| Head yaw | [-180, +180] degrees |
| Body yaw | [-160, +160] degrees |
| Yaw delta (head - body) | Max 65° difference |

Gentle collisions with body are safe. SDK clamps values automatically.

For coordinate systems and architecture details, see `docs/source/SDK/core-concept.md`.
