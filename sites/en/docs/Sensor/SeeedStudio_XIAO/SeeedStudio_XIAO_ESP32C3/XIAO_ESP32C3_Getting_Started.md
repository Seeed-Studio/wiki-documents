### Power Pins

- 5V - This is 5v out from the USB port. You can also use this as a voltage input but you must have some sort of diode (schottky, signal, power) between your external power source and this pin with anode to battery, cathode to 5V pin.
- 3V3 - This is the regulated output from the onboard regulator. You can draw 700mA
- GND - Power/data/signal ground

### Strapping Pins

According to the chip manual of ESP32C3, **GPIO2**, **GPIO8** and **GPIO9** in the chip are Strapping Pins, the high and low level configurations of these pins may allow the chip to enter into different Boot modes, please pay attention to this point when you use these pins, otherwise it may prevent your XIAO from uploading or executing the program all the time.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_WiFi/20.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

## Getting started

First, we are going to connect XIAO ESP32C3 to the computer, connect an LED to the board and upload a simple code from Arduino IDE to check whether the board is functioning well by blinking the connected LED.

### Hardware Preparation

You need to prepare the following:

- 1 x [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3](https://www.seeedstudio.com/seeed-xiao-esp32c3-p-5431.html)
- 1 x Computer
- 1 x USB Type-C cable

:::tip

Some USB cables can only supply power and cannot transfer data. If you don't have a USB cable or don't know if your USB cable can transmit data, you can check [Seeed USB Type-C support USB 3.1](https://www.seeedstudio.com/USB-3-1-Type-C-to-A-Cable-1-Meter-3-1A-p-4085.html).

:::

- **Step 1.** Connect XIAO ESP32C3 to your computer via a USB Type-C cable.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_WiFi/cable-connect.png" style={{width:120, height:'auto'}}/></div>

- **Step 2.** Connect an LED to D10 pin as follows

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_WiFi/connect-led-2.png" style={{width:500, height:'auto'}}/></div>

**Note:** Make sure to connect a resistor (about 150Ω) in series to limit the current through the LED and to prevent excess current that can burn out the LED

### Software Preparation

- **Step 1.** Download and Install the latest version of Arduino IDE according to your operating system

<p style={{textAlign:'center'}}><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software" target="_blank"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_Stalker_V3_1/images/Download_IDE.png" /></a></p>

- **Step 2.** Launch the Arduino application

- **Step 3.** Add ESP32 board package to your Arduino IDE

Navigate to **File > Preferences**, and fill **"Additional Boards Manager URLs"** with the url below:
*[https://jihulab.com/esp-mirror/espressif/arduino-esp32.git](https://jihulab.com/esp-mirror/espressif/arduino-esp32.git)*

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_WiFi/add_board.png" style={{width:550, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Navigate to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager...**, type the keyword "**esp32**" in the search box, select the latest version of **esp32**, and install it.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_WiFi/add_esp32c3.png" style={{width:550, height:'auto'}}/></div>

- **Step 4.** Select your board and port

**Board**

Navigate to **Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino** and select "**XIAO_ESP32C3**". The list of board is a little long and you need to roll to the buttom to reach it.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32/XIAO_ESP32_board.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

**Port**

Navigate to **Tools > Port** and select the serial port name of the connected XIAO ESP32C3. This is likely to be COM3 or higher (**COM1** and **COM2** are usually reserved for hardware serial ports).

### Run your first Blink program

- **Step 1.** Copy the below code to Arduino IDE

Make sure your `D10` is connected to an LED as shown in the diagram above.

```cpp

// define led according to pin diagram in article
const int led = D10; // there is no LED_BUILTIN available for the XIAO ESP32C3.

void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin led as an output
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on 
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
```

- **Step 2.** Click the **Upload** button to upload the code to the board

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino_GPRS/img/upload_image.png" style={{width:500, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Once uploaded, you will see the connected LED blinking with a 1-second delay between each blink. This means the connection is successful and now you can explore more projects with XIAO ESP32C3!

## Battery Usage

The XIAO ESP32C3 is capable of using a 3.7V lithium battery as the power supply input. You can refer to the following diagram for the wiring method.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_WiFi/battery_connect.png" alt="pir" width="600" height="auto"/></div>

:::caution
Please be careful not to short-circuit the positive and negative terminals and burn the battery and equipment when soldering.
:::

**Instructions on the use of batteries:**

1. Please use qualified batteries that meet the specifications.
2. XIAO can be connected to your computer device via data cable while using the battery, rest assured that XIAO has a built-in circuit protection chip, which is safe.
3. The XIAO ESP32C3 will not have any LED on when it is battery powered (unless you have written a specific program), please do not judge whether the XIAO ESP32C3 is working or not by the condition of the LED, please judge it reasonably by your program.
4. Sorry, we currently have no way to help you check the remaining battery level through software (because there are no more chip pins available), you need to charge the battery regularly or use a multimeter to check the battery level.

### Check the battery voltage

Due to the limitation of the number of pins in the ESP32C3, engineers had no extra pins to allocate to the battery for voltage measurement in order to ensure that the XIAO ESP32C3 has the same number of GPIOs as the other XIAO series available.

But if you prefer to use a separate pin for battery voltage measurement, you can refer to the genius operation of [msfujino](https://forum.seeedstudio.com/u/msfujino). We would also like to give a special thanks to [msfujino](https://forum.seeedstudio.com/u/msfujino) for all the experience and efforts shared for the XIAO ESP32C3.

The basic operating idea is: The battery voltage was divided by 1/2 with 200k and connected to the A0 port so that the voltage could be monitored.

<div align="center"><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/XIAO_WiFi/3.png" alt="pir" width="300" height="auto"/></div>

The datasheet says nominally 2500mV full scale AD conversion, but there is a large variation from chip to chip, actually ±10%. My chip was 2700mV full scale.

Fortunately, the calibrated correction value for each chip is written in the fuse area, and by using the function `analogReadMilliVolts()`, I can read the corrected voltage value without doing anything special.

The result of AD conversion and the voltage measured by the multimeter agree well with each other with an error of about 5 mV, which is not a problem in practical use.

In addition, during communication in particular, spike-like errors occurred, which had to be averaged out 16 times to remove them.

The following is the procedure to test the battery voltage.

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(A0, INPUT);         // ADC
}

void loop() {
  uint32_t Vbatt = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    Vbatt = Vbatt + analogReadMilliVolts(A0); // ADC with correction   
  }
  float Vbattf = 2 * Vbatt / 16 / 1000.0;     // attenuation ratio 1/2, mV --> V
  Serial.println(Vbattf, 3);
  delay(1000);
}
```

:::tip
The above is from Seeed Studio forum user **msfujino**, originally posted at:
[https://forum.seeedstudio.com/t/battery-voltage-monitor-and-ad-conversion-for-xiao-esp32c/267535](https://forum.seeedstudio.com/t/battery-voltage-monitor-and-ad-conversion-for-xiao-esp32c/267535).
We recommend that you have good hands-on skills and better soldering skills before attempting to measure battery voltage based on the above, and be cautious of dangerous actions such as shorting out batteries.

## Deep sleep mode and wake-up

The XIAO ESP32C3 is designed to support deep sleep mode and wake-up functions. For the use of these two functions, we provide the following usage examples.

```cpp
#define BUTTON_PIN_BITMASK 0x200000000 // 2^33 in hex

RTC_DATA_ATTR int bootCount = 0;

/*
Method to print the reason by which ESP32
has been awaken from sleep
*/
void print_wakeup_reason(){
  esp_sleep_wakeup_cause_t wakeup_reason;

  wakeup_reason = esp_sleep_get_wakeup_cause();

  switch(wakeup_reason)
  {
    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_EXT0 : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by external signal using RTC_IO"); break;
    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_EXT1 : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by external signal using RTC_CNTL"); break;
    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_TIMER : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by timer"); break;
    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_TOUCHPAD : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by touchpad"); break;
    case ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_ULP : Serial.println("Wakeup caused by ULP program"); break;
    default : Serial.printf("Wakeup was not caused by deep sleep: %d\n",wakeup_reason); break;
  }
}

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(115200);
  delay(1000); //Take some time to open up the Serial Monitor

  //Increment boot number and print it every reboot
  ++bootCount;
  Serial.println("Boot number: " + String(bootCount));

  //Print the wakeup reason for ESP32
  print_wakeup_reason();

  esp_deep_sleep_enable_gpio_wakeup(BIT(D1), ESP_GPIO_WAKEUP_GPIO_LOW);

  //Go to sleep now
  Serial.println("Going to sleep now");
  esp_deep_sleep_start();
  Serial.println("This will never be printed");
}

void loop(){
  //This is not going to be called
}
```

If you are quick enough to turn on the serial monitor before the XIAO goes into deep sleep, then you can see the message output as shown below. This means that the XIAO is now "asleep".

:::tip
After entering deep sleep mode, the XIAO's port will disappear and you'll need to wake it up to see its port number again!
:::

In the program, we are using a **D1** low level to wake up. This means that we can connect a button to pin D1 and the XIAO will wake up when we press the button.

:::caution
The XIAO ESP32-C3 supports GPIO wake-up and timer wake-up, and the pins that support wake-up are D0~D3.

## Troubleshooting

### Q1: My Arduino IDE is stuck when uploading code to the board

You can first try to reset the board by clicking the **RESET BUTTON** once while the board is connected to your PC. If that does not work, hold the **BOOT BUTTON**, connect the board to your PC while holding the **BOOT** button, and then release it to enter **bootloader mode**.

### Q2: My board is not showing up as a serial device on Arduino IDE

Follow the same answer as for **Q1** above.

### Q3: I want to reflash the bootloader with factory firmware

You can simply connect the board to a PC via **USB Type-C** and reflash the bootloader with factory firmware by using **ESP RF Test Tool**.

- **Step 1.** Hold on the **BOOT BUTTON** and connect XIAO ESP32C3 to the PC to enter **bootloader mode**

- **Step 2.** After it is connected, release the BOOT BUTTON

- **Step 3.** Visit [this page](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools) and download **ESP RF Test Tool and Test Guide**
